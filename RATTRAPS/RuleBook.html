         To live is to know the internal experience, or perhaps it's structure, which created all those who came before us, and all who will come after. The <b>Human Experience</b> is alike between individuals. Through the assumption of roles (or Characters) we can learn to better understand ourselves, and our peers with whom we share this life, it's beauties, and it's sorrows. <br><br>
    <span style="display:block;text-align:center;">This is the purpose behind <b>RATTRAPS</b>.</span><br><br> 
         <b>RATTRAPS</b> is a role play system designed with realism at the forefront. As such, all systems have been derived from their scientific and historical counterparts. <br>
         In service of this, <span class="Term" id="Argument">The Rule of Argument</span> superceedes all others. This is the principal that; <b>If an argument can be made sound, the action may be allowed.</b> The G.M. will have final say in determining what constitutes a sound argument, but if, using logical principals and historical president, a Directing Player can satisfactorily articulate that a certain feat should be possible. This will override any rule herein.<br>
    The purpose of <b>RATTRAPS</b> is ultimately the simulation of reality, for the purpose of exploring Characters. Thus the <b>rules</b> are always subordinate to the <b>logic</b> that was used to create them. <br>
    <br>This rule also helps as a Directing Player's balance against the falible G.M. and helps to ensure a fair representation of their character.

         <b>RATTRAPS</b>
     is most commonly played via correspondence, with each directing player in isolation from one another. this preserves anonymity, and allows players to immerse themselves fully in their character's thought process and decision making style absent the social pressures of a party, or group. <br>
    Betrayers betray, thieves steal, and villains must commit villainy. The only punishment to be faced for realizing your character well, are to be dealt unto the character in the form of reactions from the word and it's inhabitants, including other characters directed by other players. 
    Communities are policed, murders are investigated, and crimes are punished via a judicial systems and avengers.<br>
    One should not hold back from themselves for the sake of others.
    <br><br>
    Players will take turns with their G.M., with the players directing their character's in response to the developments provided from the G.M.. <br>
    Players will be assisted in tracking their character's needs and abilities using their Character Sheet.<br>
    <br>This forms the basic structure of the game.<br><br>
    Below will be listed, in detail, all the terms, and mechanics that will be used in the course of a campaign.
