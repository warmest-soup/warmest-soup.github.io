           To live is to know the internal experience, or perhaps it's structure, which created all those who came
      before us, and all who will come after. The <b>Human Experience</b> is alike between individuals. Through the
      assumption of roles (or characters) we can learn to better understand ourselves, and our peers with whom we share
      this life, it's beauties, and it's sorrows. <br><br>
      <span style="display:block;text-align:center;">This is the purpose behind <b>RATTRAPS</b>.</span><br><br>
           <b>RATTRAPS</b> is a role play system designed with realism at the forefront. As such, all systems have been
      derived from their scientific and historical counterparts. <br>
           In service of this, <span class="Term" id="Argument">The Rule of Argument</span> superceedes all others. This
      is the principal that; <b>If an argument can be made sound, the action may be allowed.</b> The G.M. will have
      final say in determining what constitutes a sound argument, but if, using logical principals and historical
      president, a directing player can satisfactorily articulate that a certain feat should be possible. This will
      override any rule herein.<br>
      The purpose of <b>RATTRAPS</b> is ultimately the simulation of reality, for the purpose of exploring characters.
      Thus the <b>rules</b> are always subordinate to the <b>logic</b> that was used to create them. <br>
      <br>This rule also helps as a directing player's balance against the falible G.M. and helps to ensure a fair
      representation of their character.

    <div class="header" id="Game-Flow">
           <b>RATTRAPS</b>
      is most commonly played via correspondence, with each directing player in isolation from one another. this
      preserves anonymity, and allows players to immerse themselves fully in their character's thought process and
      decision making style absent the social pressures of a party, or group. <br>
      Betrayers betray, thieves steal, and villains must commit villainy. The only punishment to be faced for realizing
      your character well, are to be dealt unto the character in the form of reactions from the word and it's
      inhabitants, including other characters directed by other players.
      Communities are policed, murders are investigated, and crimes are punished via a judicial systems and
      avengers.<br>
      One should not hold back from themselves for the sake of others.
      <br><br>
      Players will take turns with their G.M., with the players directing their character's in response to the
      developments provided from the G.M.. <br>
      Players will be assisted in tracking their character's needs and abilities using their character sheet.<br>
      <br>This forms the basic structure of the game.<br><br>
      Below will be listed, in detail, all the terms, and mechanics that will be used in the course of a run.

    <div id="definitions">
      <div class="header">
        <span class="Subdivision">-General-</span><br>

        <span class="Term" id="G.M.">Game Manager: </Span> The player responsible for rendering the game world, and
        directing NPCs. This player also will narrate the unconcious thoughts of player characters. These thoughts will
        <b>never</b> affect their decision making or personality, but will give their directing players a better
        understanding of their character's physical and mental state. For example the remnant feelings of pain from a
        past
        injury, or the sensations caused by failed checks are within the realm of the game manager's control, not the
        directing player.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Direction">Direction: </Span> <i style="text-decoration:underline;">You are not your
          character.</i> in <b>RATTRAPS</b>
        characters have their own skillsets & abilities that they'll have to use in order to solve their problems. These
        abilities are often times unequal to the directing player's own faculties, thus it is better to approach your
        character not from the mindset of <i>"controlling"</i> them, but rather you are "<i>directing</i>" their
        actions.
        <br> They are their own person, and you are aiding them along, immersing yourself in their life.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Player">Player: </Span> There exist two kinds of players in <b>RATTRAPS</b>; One is the
        G.M. while the others all direct their own individual characters. The generic term players most often refers to
        the latter kind.<br>
        It is the job of <i>these</i> players to immerse themselves in the role of their characters, and embody their
        personalities when directing their actions. <br>
        Players are <b>not</b> expected to cooperate, or ally themselves with one another. In fact this behavior is
        discouraged if it would compromise the character's own way of thinking.<br>
        To this end it is recommended that players maintain their anonymity during a run. Not knowing what player is
        directing what character helps to ensure authentic interactions and prevents interpersonal tensions.
        <i>You are not your characters.</i><br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Character">Character: </Span> Each player will create their own character. these can be
        anyone, accountants, adventurers, soldiers, vilains, royalty, <i>anyone</i>. These characters will be defined by
        their traits & abilities as well as by the <i>personality</i> that their directing player chooses to give
        them.<br>
        Players will direct their character until the run ends, or until the character retires, or dies.<br> These
        characters, and their interactions, are the backbone of <b>RATTRAPS</b>. It is through them that we can learn
        about ourselves, and the peers we share this life with.<br>
        Players will be aided in the managment of their characters by their character sheets, which contain all manner
        of
        helpful & necessary functions. <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="NPC">Non-Player Characters: </Span> It is the G.M.'s responsibility to fill the game
        world
        with interesting <i>"NPCs"</i> for the main cast to interact with. These will include the local citizenry, law
        enforcement, rivals, allies, enemys, and any other necessary persons to give the world it's depth.<br>
        During the character creation process, players may request that the G.M. direct NPC companions for their
        character. This can be a massive advantage, as well as a great enhancement to one's story through the run.
        <br>
        NPCs can also be generated at random through the Tarot system. <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Cast">Cast: </Span> The cast refers collectively to all player characters. As these
        characters have the full creative attention of their directing players behind them, they will easily be the most
        interesting entities in any given run, as well as most likely to drive it's plot forward.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Char-Sheet">Character Sheet: </Span> A player's character sheet is their most important
        resource. It tracks experience, satiety, HP, statuses, inventory, time of day, all critical to the direction of
        one's character. Below is a list of sections that can be found on one's character sheet.<br><br>
        Traits <br>
        Abilities <br>
        Satiety & Time <br>
        Temperature <br>

        <span class="Term" id="Run">Run: </Span> <b>RATTRAPS</b> centers around the interconnected stories of it's Cast.
        <b>There is no goal in RATTRAPS.</b> Instead these stories and wander and weave in and out of eachother as each
        character pursues their own individual goals.<br> Runs are primarily defined by the creative team behind them.
        This includes the G.M. as well as all the involved players.<br>
      </div>

      <div class="header">
        <span class="Subdivision">-Mechanics-</span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Checks">Checks: </Span> Whenever a character's abilities are tested, a check is
        performed. The player will roll a pair of standard seven-sum dice. If the <b>lower</b> of the <span>die</span>
        is <b>equal to or less than</b> the check's bar, then the check <b>succeeds</b> granting a favorable outcome to
        performing character. <br>If both dice are <b>greater than</b> the bar, then the check <b>fails</b> granting the
        character a negative outcome.<br>
        Should both rolled <span>die</span> show the <b>same</b> number (A pair), the result is considered critical.<br>
        <br> The bar for checks can be raised by advantages and will be lowered penalties. Unfavorable rolls can be
        adjusted using the focus mechanic.<br>
        <br> Some checks will ignore all penalties and advantages. these are referred to as <b>flat</b> checks.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="50-50">50-50: </Span> A less common style of check, used primarily by the G.M., in which
        a singe dice is rolled with all odd numbers representing one option, and all even numbers representing a
        second.<br> These are most often used to make quick determinations in situations with two acceptable outcomes,
        and rarely will be used to make decisions of true importance.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Bar">Bar: </Span> The highest number a character can roll to pass an ability check. If
        the tested ability's rank is 3, the character <b>must roll a 3 or below</b> to pass.<br>
        The bar of checks is always modified by the total number of penalties & advantages applied to it.<br>
        <br> Players will often need to estimate what the bar is for their checks based on the situation, and their
        character. one advantage will cancel out one penalty.

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Advantage">Advantages: </Span> Advantages are anything that makes an ability check
        <b>easier</b> for the performing character.<br>
        For example; were a character to attempt to leap across a gap in the floor, having footwear that grants extra
        traction would be an advantage in their favor. The floor being level and even, with no obstructions, would be
        another advantage.<br> Since <b>each advantage raises the bar by 1</b> the hypothetical check above would have
        it's bar raised by 2, making it <b>significantly</b> easier to pass.<br>
        <br> Advantages such as the ones used in the above example, that are derived from the current situation, are
        referred to as <b>Contextual Advantages</b>. These can be stacked with any incumbent advantages to greatly
        reduce the risk faced by the performing character, so be sure to always consider your situation carefully before
        rolling. <br>
        <br> Every advantage on a passed check will decrease the exp earned for passing by 1.</b><br> In the event that
        an ability class or technique is used as an advantage in a check, experience lost will be awarded to the
        <b>first class advantage noted.</b><br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Penalty">Penalties: </Span> Penalties are anything that makes an ability check <b>more
          difficult</b> for the performing character.<br> For example; were a character to attempt reading a dense
        academic book, dim lighting would be a penalty. Were the character on a bumpy wagon ride, the erratic motions
        would be another penalty.<br>
        Since <b>each penalty lowers the bar by 1</b> the hypothetical check above would have it's bar decreased by 2,
        making it <b>significantly</b> more difficult to pass.<br>
        <br> Penalties such as the ones used in the above example, that are derived from the current situation, are
        referred to as <b>Contextual Penalties</b>. These will be <span>stacked</span> with any incumbent penalties to
        greatly increase the difficulty faced by the performing character. Be sure to always consider your situation
        carefully before rolling. <br>
        <br><b>The G.M. will not inform players of contextual penalties when they are performing a check.</b><br>Always
        exersize your own caution when directing characters.<br>
        <br> Every penalty on a passed check will increase the exp earned for passing by 1.</b><br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Incumbents">Incumbents: </Span> Any trait or ability that's rank is <b>not</b> 3, has
        incumbent advantages if it's higher, and incumbent penalties if it's lower. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Rank 1:</b> 2 penalties<br>
        <b>Rank 2:</b> 1 penalties.<br>
          ⭡     ⭡     ⭡<br>
        <b style="text-decoration:underline;">Rank 3:</b> No inbumbents.<br>
          ⭣     ⭣     ⭣<br>
        <b>Rank 4:</b> 1 advantages.<br>
        <b>Rank 5:</b> 2 advantages. <br>
        <br>
        <br> These are representative of
        your mastery (<i>Or lack thereof</i>) of the ability in question. <br> Incumbent advantages & penalties will
        still modify the experience earned from checks. Meaning it's <b>more difficult</b> to earn experience for high
        rank abilities, as they require more difficult checks to earn experience.<br><br>Incumbents are lost and earned
        naturally as a character progresses through ranks. <b>all abilities</b> are affected by incumbents. <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Quirks">Quirks: </Span> During character creation, when setting their trait ranks,
        Players can choose to replace incumbent advantages or penalties with positive or negative quirks related to the
        trait in question.<br>
        Penalties <b>must</b> be replaced with <b>negative</b> quirks, while penalties <b>must</b> be replaced with
        <b>positive</b> quirks.<br> Quirks are in essence, niche advantages & penalties, that are unlikely to affect all
        your checks, but due to their nature may affect checks for more than just the trait they're under. <br>For
        example; A character might choose arachnophobia as a Wisdom Quirk. They will no longer need to overcome their
        incumbent Penalty, but will have to deal with more severe penalties when around spiders, or things that remind
        them of spiders.<br><br> Quirks can be used to turn Penalties into advantages through their unintended side
        effects. Another example; A character might choose to take paranoia as a negative Perception Quirk. This might
        cause unnecesary checks, but would also grant advantages in the event of a real threat. More frequent checks
        would also lead to more experience gained.<br><br> Unlike incumbents, Quirks do not dissapear as one raises
        their trait ranks. when an incumbent penalty is replaced with a negative quirk, that quirk is kept indefinitely.
        Whenever a character raises a Quirked trait rank, the directing player may choose <b>not to raise their rank</b>
        in order to remove their negative quirk.<br><br>
        Quirks can also be gained or lost rarely through developments in a character's personal story.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Seven-Sum">Seven-Sum Dice: </Span> <b>RATTRAPS</b> is played using two standard Seven-Sum
        Dice. This means that oppopsite faces will always add up to seven. (Five is opposite two, six is opposite
        one.)<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Focus">Focus: </Span> Character's can modify <b>any</b> dice roll using the relavant
        trait. Dex is used to focus skill rolls, while Wisdom is used to focus insight rolls.<br><br> When focusing a
        roll, the either dice maybe raised or lowered by one, as many times as the performing character has ranks in the
        relavant trait.<br><br>

        Focusing a roll costs one card of relavant type.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Rank">Rank: </Span> A character's talent in any given trait or class. Ranks determine the
        natural bar of checks which become easier as Ranks increase, as well as that ability's incumbents.<br> Trait
        Ranks also determine a character's access to quirks while technique class ranks often provide clas bonuses that
        grow in effectiveness with higher ranks.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Traits">Traits: </Span> The fundemental abilities that define a character. Traits are
        generic, and widely applicable abilities. Like all abilities, they recieve incumbents, but unlike skills &

        determines they effectiveness with edged weapons, how likely they are to be disarmed, as well as how many
        actions they're able to perform in one round of combat. <br> Dexterity is extremely useful for finer actions,
        such as playing instruments, writing, and Precision striking.<br><br> Dexterity is also the trait used to focus
        skill rolls and checks.<br>
