           To live is to know the internal experience, or perhaps it's structure, which created all those who came
      before us, and all who will come after. The <b>Human Experience</b> is alike between individuals. Through the
      assumption of roles (or characters) we can learn to better understand ourselves, and our peers with whom we share
      this life, it's beauties, and it's sorrows. <br><br>
      <span style="display:block;text-align:center;">This is the purpose behind <b>RATTRAPS</b>.</span><br><br>
           <b>RATTRAPS</b> is a role play system designed with realism at the forefront. As such, all systems have been
      derived from their scientific and historical counterparts. <br>
           In service of this, <span class="Term" id="Argument">The Rule of Argument</span> superceedes all others. This
      is the principal that; <b>If an argument can be made sound, the action may be allowed.</b> The G.M. will have
      final say in determining what constitutes a sound argument, but if, using logical principals and historical
      president, a directing player can satisfactorily articulate that a certain feat should be possible. This will
      override any rule herein.<br>
      The purpose of <b>RATTRAPS</b> is ultimately the simulation of reality, for the purpose of exploring characters.
      Thus the <b>rules</b> are always subordinate to the <b>logic</b> that was used to create them. <br>
      <br>This rule also helps as a directing player's balance against the falible G.M. and helps to ensure a fair
      representation of their character.

    <div class="header" id="Game-Flow">
           <b>RATTRAPS</b>
      is most commonly played via correspondence, with each directing player in isolation from one another. this
      preserves anonymity, and allows players to immerse themselves fully in their character's thought process and
      decision making style absent the social pressures of a party, or group. <br>
      Betrayers betray, thieves steal, and villains must commit villainy. The only punishment to be faced for realizing
      your character well, are to be dealt unto the character in the form of reactions from the word and it's
      inhabitants, including other characters directed by other players.
      Communities are policed, murders are investigated, and crimes are punished via a judicial systems and
      avengers.<br>
      One should not hold back from themselves for the sake of others.
      <br><br>
      Players will take turns with their G.M., with the players directing their character's in response to the
      developments provided from the G.M.. <br>
      Players will be assisted in tracking their character's needs and abilities using their character sheet.<br>
      <br>This forms the basic structure of the game.<br><br>
      Below will be listed, in detail, all the terms, and mechanics that will be used in the course of a run.
    </div>

    <div id="definitions">
      <span class="Term" id="G.M.">Game Manager: </Span> The player responsible for rendering the game world, and
      directing NPCs. This player also will narrate the unconcious thoughts of player characters. These thoughts will
      <b>never</b> affect their decision making or personality, but will give their directing players a better
      understanding of their character's physical and mental state. For example the remnant feelings of pain from a past
      injury, or the sensations caused by failed checks are within the realm of the game manager's control, not the
      directing player.<br>

      <br>
      <span class="Term" id="Direction">Direction: </Span> <i style="text-decoration:underline;">You are not your
        character.</i> in <b>RATTRAPS</b>
      characters have their own skillsets & abilities that they'll have to use in order to solve their problems. These
      abilities are often times unequal to the directing player's own faculties, thus it is better to approach your
      character not from the mindset of <i>"controlling"</i> them, but rather you are "<i>directing</i>" their actions.
      <br> They are their own person, and you are aiding them along, immersing yourself in their life.<br>

      <br>
      <span class="Term" id="Player">Player: </Span> There exist two kinds of players in <b>RATTRAPS</b>; One is the
      G.M. while the others all direct their own individual characters. The generic term players most often refers to
      the latter kind.<br>
      It is the job of <i>these</i> players to immerse themselves in the role of their characters, and embody their
      personalities when directing their actions. <br>
      Players are <b>not</b> expected to cooperate, or ally themselves with one another. In fact this behavior is
      discouraged if it would compromise the character's own way of thinking.<br>
      To this end it is recommended that players maintain their anonymity during a run. Not knowing what player is
      directing what character helps to ensure authentic interactions and prevents interpersonal tensions.
      <i>You are not your characters.</i><br>

      <br>
      <span class="Term" id="Character">Character: </Span> Each player will create their own character. these can be
      anyone, accountants, adventurers, soldiers, vilains, royalty, <i>anyone</i>. These characters will be defined by
      their traits & abilities as well as by the <i>personality</i> that their directing player chooses to give
      them.<br>
      Players will direct their character until the run ends, or until the character retires, or dies.<br> These
      characters, and their interactions, are the backbone of <b>RATTRAPS</b>. It is through them that we can learn
      about ourselves, and the peers we share this life with.<br>
      Players will be aided in the managment of their characters by their character sheets, which contain all manner of
      helpful & necessary functions. <br>

      <br>
      <span class="Term" id="NPC">Non-Player Characters: </Span> It is the G.M.'s responsibility to fill the game world
      with interesting <i>"NPCs"</i> for the main cast to interact with. These will include the local citizenry, law
      enforcement, rivals, allies, enemys, and any other necessary persons to give the world it's depth.<br>
      During the character creation process, players may request that the G.M. direct NPC companions for their
      character. This can be a massive advantage, as well as a great enhancement to one's story through the run.
      <br>
      NPCs can also be generated at random through the Tarot system. <br>

      <br>
      <span class="Term" id="Cast">Cast: </Span> The cast refers collectively to all player characters. As these
      characters have the full creatiVe attention of their directing players behind them, they will easily be the most
      interesting entities in any given run, as well as most likely to drive it's plot forward.<br>

      <br>
      <span class="Term" id="Char-Sheet">Character Sheet: </Span> A player's character sheet is their most important
      resource. It tracks experience, satiety, HP, statuses, inventory, time of day, all critical to the direction of
      one's character. Below is a list of sections that can be found on one's character sheet.<br><br>
      Traits <br>
