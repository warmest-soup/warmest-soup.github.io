      To live is to know the internal experience, or perhaps its structure, which created all those who came
      before us, and all who will come after. The <b>Human Experience</b> is alike between individuals. Through the
      assumption of roles (or characters) we can learn to better understand ourselves, and our peers with whom we share
      this life, it's beauties, and it's sorrows. <br><br>
      <span style="display:block;text-align:center;">This is the purpose behind <b>RATTRAPS</b>.</span><br><br>
      <b>RATTRAPS</b> is a role play system designed with realism at the forefront. As such, all systems have been
      derived from their scientific and historical counterparts. <br>
      In service of this, <span class="Term" id="Argument">The Rule of Argument</span> supersedes all others. This
      is the principle that; <b>If an argument can be made sound, the action may be allowed.</b> The G.M. will have
      final say in determining what constitutes a sound argument, but if, using logical principles and historical
      president, a directing player can satisfactorily articulate that a certain feat should be possible. This will
      override any rule herein.<br>
      The purpose of <b>RATTRAPS</b> is ultimately the simulation of reality, for the purpose of exploring characters.
      Thus the <b>rules</b> are always subordinate to the <b>logic</b> that was used to create them. <br>
      <br>This rule also helps as a directing player's balance against the fallible G.M. and helps to ensure a fair
      representation of their character.

      <b id="Game-Flow">RATTRAPS</b>
      is most commonly played via correspondence, with each directing player in isolation from one another. this
      preserves anonymity, and allows players to immerse themselves fully in their character's thought process and
      decision making style absent the social pressures of a party, or group. <br>
      Betrayers betray, thieves steal, and villains must commit villainy. The only punishment to be faced for realizing
      your character well, are to be dealt unto the character in the form of reactions from the word and it's
      inhabitants, including other characters directed by other players.
      Communities are policed, murders are investigated, and crimes are punished via a judicial systems and
      avengers.<br>
      One should not hold back from themselves for the sake of others.
      <br><br>
      Players will take turns with their G.M., with the players directing their characters in response to the
      developments provided from the G.M.. <br>
      Players will be assisted in tracking their character's needs and abilities using their character sheet.<br>
      <br>This forms the basic structure of the game.<br><br>
      Below will be listed, in detail, all the terms, and mechanics that will be used in the course of a run.

      <div class="header">
        <span class="Subdivision">-General-</span><br>

        <span class="Term" id="G.M.">Game Manager: </Span> The player responsible for rendering the game world, and
        directing NPCs. This player also will narrate the unconscious thoughts of player characters. These thoughts will
        <b>never</b> affect their decision making or personality, but will give their directing players a better
        understanding of their character's physical and mental state. For example the remnant feelings of pain from a
        past
        injury, or the sensations caused by failed checks are within the realm of the game manager's control, not the
        directing player.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Direction">Direction: </Span> <i style="text-decoration:underline;">You are not your
          character.</i> in <b>RATTRAPS</b>
        characters have their own skillsets & abilities that they'll have to use in order to solve their problems. These
        abilities are often times unequal to the directing player's own faculties, thus it is better to approach your
        character not from the mindset of <i>"controlling"</i> them, but rather you are "<i>directing</i>" their
        actions.
        <br> They are their own person, and you are aiding them along, immersing yourself in their life.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Player">Player: </Span> There exist two kinds of players in <b>RATTRAPS</b>; One is the
        G.M. while the others all direct their own individual characters. The generic term players most often refers to
        the latter kind.<br>
        It is the job of <i>these</i> players to immerse themselves in the role of their characters, and embody their
        personalities when directing their actions. <br>
        Players are <b>not</b> expected to cooperate, or ally themselves with one another. In fact this behavior is
        discouraged if it would compromise the character's own way of thinking.<br>
        To this end it is recommended that players maintain their anonymity during a run. Not knowing what player is
        directing what character helps to ensure authentic interactions and prevents interpersonal tensions.
        <i>You are not your characters.</i><br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Character">Character: </Span> Each player will create their own character. These can be
        anyone, accountants, adventurers, soldiers, villains, royalty, <i>anyone</i>. These characters will be defined
        by
        their traits & abilities as well as by the <i>personality</i> that their directing player chooses to give
        them.<br>
        Players will direct their character until the run ends, or until the character retires, or dies.<br> These
        characters, and their interactions, are the backbone of <b>RATTRAPS</b>. It is through them that we can learn
        about ourselves, and the peers we share this life with.<br>
        Players will be aided in the management of their characters by their character sheets, which contain all manner
        of
        helpful & necessary functions. <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="NPC">Non-Player Characters: </Span> It is the G.M.'s responsibility to fill the game
        world
        with interesting <i>"NPCs"</i> for the main cast to interact with. These will include the local citizenry, law
        enforcement, rivals, allies, enemies, and any other necessary persons to give the world its depth.<br>
        During the character creation process, players may request that the G.M. direct NPC companions for their
        character. This can be a massive advantage, as well as a great enhancement to one's story through the run.
        <br>
        NPCs can also be generated at random through the Tarot system. <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Cast">Cast: </Span> The cast refers collectively to all player characters. As these
        characters have the full creative attention of their directing players behind them, they will easily be the most
        interesting entities in any given run, as well as most likely to drive its plot forward.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Char-Sheet">Character Sheet: </Span> A player's character sheet is their most important
        resource. It tracks experience, satiety, HP, statuses, inventory, time of day, all critical to the direction of
        one's character. Below is a list of sections that can be found on one's character sheet.<br><br>
        Traits <br>
        Abilities <br>
        Satiety & Time <br>
        Temperature <br>
        Files <br>
        Notes <br>
        Weapon <br>
        Battle Ticket <br>
        Wellbeing <br>
        Maps <br>
        Inventory <br>
        Tack <br>
        Resistances <br>
        Armor Grids <br>
        Storage <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Run">Run: </Span> <b>RATTRAPS</b> centers around the interconnected stories of its Cast.
        <b>There is no goal in RATTRAPS.</b> Instead these stories and wander and weave in and out of each other as each
        character pursues their own individual goals.<br> Runs are primarily defined by the creative team behind them.
        This includes the G.M. as well as all the involved players.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Context">Context: </Span> The term "Context" Is used to refer to advantages, bonuses, and
        modifiers derived from the relavant character's <b>current situation.</b>
        <br> For example, a <b>Context Advantage</b> is an advantage that exists only due to the character's current
        situation, such as having access to written instructions on how to perform a task, being assisted by a character
        with relavant knowledge, or having the correct tools for the job.
        <br><br>* The complexity of a task, whether something is easy or difficult from the relavant approach, is also a
        "contextual advantage" though these sorts of modifiers are solely the responsibility of the G.M.
        <br>
      </div>

      <div class="header">
        <span class="Subdivision">-Mechanics-</span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Checks">Checks: </Span> Whenever a character's abilities are tested, a check is
        performed. The player will roll a pair of standard seven-sum dice. If the <b>lower</b> of the <span>die</span>
        is <b>equal to or less than</b> the check's bar, then the check <b>succeeds</b> granting a favorable outcome to
        performing character. <br>If both dice are <b>greater than</b> the bar, then the check <b>fails</b> granting the
        character a negative outcome.<br>
        Should both rolled <span>die</span> show the <b>same</b> number (A pair), the result is considered critical.<br>
        <br> The bar for checks can be raised by advantages and will be lowered penalties. Unfavorable rolls can be
        adjusted using the focus mechanic.<br>
        <br> Ability checks come in three forms;
        <br> <b>Flat checks </b>will ignore all penalties & advantages, and cannot be focused.
        <br><b>Passive Checks </b> which will be rolled by the G.M. without informing the directing player. As such
        these cannot be focused either.
        <br><b>Active Checks</b> Which are performed at will by directing players. <br>
        <br> The G.M. will <b>always</b> inform players whenever a passive check has been performed on behalf of their
        character, but players will <b>not</b> be informed if <b>any</b> of their checks succeed or fail. This is to
        ensure authenticity in the character's reaction to their own attempts.<br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="50-50">50-50: </Span> A less common style of check, used primarily by the G.M., in which
        a single dice is rolled with all odd numbers representing one option, and all even numbers representing a
        second.<br> These are most often used to make quick determinations in situations with two acceptable outcomes,
        and rarely will be used to make decisions of true importance.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Bar">Bar: </Span> The highest number a character can roll to pass an ability check. If
        the tested ability's rank is 3, the character <b>must roll a 3 or below</b> to pass.<br>
        The bar of checks is always modified by the total number of penalties & advantages applied to it.<br>
        <br> Players will often need to estimate what the bar is for their checks based on the situation, and their
        character. One advantage will cancel out one penalty.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Advantage">Advantages: </Span> Advantages are anything that makes an ability check
        <b>easier</b> for the performing character.<br>
        For example; were a character to attempt to leap across a gap in the floor, having footwear that grants extra
        traction would be an advantage in their favor. The floor being level and even, with no obstructions, would be
        another advantage.<br> Since <b>each advantage raises the bar by 1</b> the hypothetical check above would have
        it's bar raised by 2, making it <b>significantly</b> easier to pass.<br>
        <br> Advantages such as the ones used in the above example, that are derived from the current situation, are
        referred to as <b>Contextual Advantages</b>. These can be stacked with any incumbent advantages to greatly
        reduce the risk faced by the performing character, so be sure to always consider your situation carefully before
        rolling. <br>
        <br> Every advantage on a passed check will decrease the exp earned for passing by 1.</b><br> In the event that
        an ability class or technique is used as an advantage in a check, experience lost will be awarded to the
        <b>first class advantage noted.</b><br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Penalty">Penalties: </Span> Penalties are anything that makes an ability check <b>more
          difficult</b> for the performing character.<br> For example; were a character to attempt reading a dense
        academic book, dim lighting would be a penalty. Were the character on a bumpy wagon ride, the erratic motions
        would be another penalty.<br>
        Since <b>each penalty lowers the bar by 1</b> the hypothetical check above would have its bar decreased by 2,
        making it <b>significantly</b> more difficult to pass.<br>
        <br> Penalties such as the ones used in the above example, that are derived from the current situation, are
        referred to as <b>Contextual Penalties</b>. These will be <span>stacked</span> with any incumbent penalties to
        greatly increase the difficulty faced by the performing character. Be sure to always consider your situation
        carefully before rolling. <br>
        <br><b>The G.M. will not inform players of contextual penalties when they are performing a check.</b><br>Always
        exercise your own caution when directing characters.<br>
        <br> Every penalty on a passed check will increase the exp earned for passing by 1.</b><br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Incumbents">Incumbents: </Span> Any trait or ability that's rank is <b>not</b> 3, has
        incumbent advantages if it's higher, and incumbent penalties if it's lower. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Rank 1:</b> 2 penalties<br>
        <b>Rank 2:</b> 1 penalties.<br>
        ⭡ ⭡ ⭡<br>
        <b style="text-decoration:underline;">Rank 3:</b> No incumbents.<br>
        ⭣ ⭣ ⭣<br>
        <b>Rank 4:</b> 1 advantages.<br>
        <b>Rank 5:</b> 2 advantages. <br>
        <br>
        <br> These are representative of
        your mastery (<i>Or lack thereof</i>) of the ability in question. <br> Incumbent advantages & penalties will
        still modify the experience earned from checks. Meaning it's <b>more difficult</b> to earn experience for high
        rank abilities, as they require more difficult checks to earn experience.<br><br>Incumbents are lost and earned
        naturally as a character progresses through ranks. <b>all abilities</b> are affected by incumbents. <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Quirks">Quirks: </Span> During character creation, when setting their trait ranks,
        Players can choose to replace incumbent advantages or penalties with positive or negative quirks related to the
        trait in question.<br>
        Penalties <b>must</b> be replaced with <b>negative</b> quirks, while penalties <b>must</b> be replaced with
        <b>positive</b> quirks.<br> Quirks are in essence, niche advantages & penalties, that are unlikely to affect all
        your checks, but due to their nature may affect checks for more than just the trait they're under. <br>For
        example; A character might choose arachnophobia as a Wisdom Quirk. They will no longer need to overcome their
        incumbent Penalty, but will have to deal with more severe penalties when around spiders, or things that remind
        them of spiders.<br><br> Quirks can be used to turn Penalties into advantages through their unintended side
        effects. Another example; A character might choose to take paranoia as a negative Perception Quirk. This might
        cause unnecessary checks, but would also grant advantages in the event of a real threat. More frequent checks
        would also lead to more experience gained.<br><br> Unlike incumbents, Quirks do not disappear as one raises
        their trait ranks. When an incumbent penalty is replaced with a negative quirk, that quirk is kept indefinitely.
        Whenever a character raises a Quirked trait rank, the directing player may choose <b>not to raise their rank</b>
        in order to remove their negative quirk.<br><br>
        Quirks can also be gained or lost rarely through developments in a character's personal story.
        <br><br>* Quirks are to be listed and briefly explained in the notes section of one's character sheet for the
        G.M.'s reference.
        <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Seven-Sum">Seven-Sum Dice: </Span> <b>RATTRAPS</b> is played using two standard Seven-Sum
        Dice. This means that opposite faces will always add up to seven. (Five is opposite two, six is opposite
        one.)<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Focus">Focus: </Span> Characters can modify <b>any</b> dice roll using the relevant
        trait. Dex is used to focus skill rolls, while Wisdom is used to focus insight rolls.<br><br> When focusing a
        roll, the either dice maybe raised or lowered by one, as many times as the performing character has ranks in the
        relevant trait.<br><br>

        Focusing a roll costs one card of relevant type.<br>
        <br>* Focus <b>cannot be used</b> on any roll that resulted in a <b>pair of 6s.</b><br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Rank">Rank: </Span> A character's talent in any given trait or class. Ranks determine the
        natural bar of checks which become easier as Ranks increase, as well as that ability's incumbents.<br> Trait
        Ranks also determine a character's access to quirks while technique class ranks often provide class bonuses that
        grow in effectiveness with higher ranks.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Traits">Traits: </Span> The fundamental abilities that define a character. Traits are
        generic, and widely applicable abilities. Like all abilities, they receive incumbents, but unlike skills &
        insights, the incumbents of traits can be traded for Quirks to further specialize a character.<br>

        <span class="Subdivision">-Traits-</span><br>
        <span class="Term" id="Athleticism">Athleticism: </Span> A category of traits that, together, offer an idea of a
        character's aptitude for athletics. These are the primary traits used in combat, but affect all physical fields

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Strength">Strength: </Span> A measure of a character's ability to move and carry weight.
        Strength determines how much of a load they can carry, what objects they can lift, and what weapons they have

        grappling exchanges, where strength is added to their grapple check, making foes easier to deal with.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Dexterity">Dexterity: </Span> A measure of a character's fine motor <span>skills</span>.
        Dexterity
        determines their effectiveness with edged weapons, how likely they are to be disarmed, as well as how many
        actions they're able to perform in one round of combat. <br> Dexterity is extremely useful for finer actions,
        such as playing instruments, writing, and Precision striking.<br><br> Dexterity is also the trait used to focus
        skill rolls and checks.<br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Speed">Speed: </Span> A measure of a character's gross motor <span>skills</span> and
        coordination. Speed determines they melee damage, How likely they are to recover from being destabilized,
        their resistance to being tripped, as well as how many actionable moments they have in every round of
        combat.<br> When it comes to
        combat,<b> Speed is the most important trait.</b><br>
        <br> Athleticism and its subordinate traits are considered to be skills.

        <span class="Term" id="Awareness">Awareness: </Span> A category of traits that, together, offer an idea of a
        character's understanding of the things around them. These are the primary traits used in exploration, and

        <span class="Term" id="Perception">Perception: </Span> A measure of a character's situational awareness and
        the
        acuity of their sense. Perception determines how much detail they can perceive in their environment, how easy
        it
        is to visually target objects & entities with ranged weapons & magic, and how much of their battle ticket
        *must*
        be turned in at a time. <br> For cautious characters, or those interested in gathering detail from the
        environment, perception is very important.<br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Navigation">Navigation: </Span> A measure of a character's spacial awareness and their
        ease of orienting themselves in space. Navigation determines a character's ability to avoid getting lost or

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Charisma">Charisma: </Span> A measure of a character's social awareness, and their
        ability to understand the social cues & meanings behind the words of others. For social characters, charisma

        <span class="Term" id="Stamina">Stamina: </Span> A measure of a character's physical fitness, and how well
        they can ignore physical discomfort. Stamina primarily determines the maximum number of skill cards a
        character has access to,
        and thus, how often they can use techniques or focus.<br><br>* Stmaina checks can be used to resist
        discomfort, or prolong actions beyond when they should normally end. Forcing yourself through something
        through sheer force of will is an example of a stamina check.

        <span class="Term" id="Endurance">Endurance: </Span> A measure of a character's physical Toughness, and how
        difficult they are to injure. Determines a character's natural DT, as well as their pain tolerance.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Constitution">Constitution: </Span> A measure of the efficiency with which a
        character's body operates, and how difficult it is to disturb those operations. Constitution determines a
        character's
        natural damage reduction, their DP, their temperature tolerance, and their toxic resistance.<br><br>A
        character
        with high constitution will also have a much easier time keeping themselves composed in stressful
        circumstances,
        such as being startled.<br><br>* Constitution is used to <b>passively resist</b> involuntary reactions, such
        as being startled, being nauseated, or paralyzed.

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Mind">Mind: </Span> A category of traits that, together, offer an idea of a character's
        mental prowess. These traits represent a character's ability to think and problem solve, these tend to be very
        important for investigative characters. <br> Mind includes Intelligence, Knowledge, and Wisdom.<br><br> Mind
        and
        its subordinate traits
        are considered to be Insights. <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Intelligence">Intelligence: </Span> A measure of the efficiency with which a
        character's
        mind operates, its clarity and quickness. Intelligence determines how many abilities can be held in memory,
        how
        difficult it is to retrieve forgotten abilities, and how well a character can process information.
        Intelligence
        also determines one's ability to perform mental functions, such as arithmetic.
        <br>
        <br>* Intelligence Checks can be used to double the experience gained from previous checks.<br>
        <br> * During sleep abilities can be swapped in and out of memory freely. This effect ends upon waking up.
        <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Wisdom">Wisdom: </Span> A measure of a character's ability to think in abstract terms,
        grasp deeper concepts, and their creativity. Wisdom determines the maximum potency of cast spells, how
        difficult
        it is to modify one's spells, as well as a character's aptitude for logical reasoning, and critical thinking.
        Art appreciation, riddles, and philosophy are all within the realm of Wisdom.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Knowledge">Knowledge: </Span> A measure of the vastness of generic information kept in
        a
        character's mind at all times. This includes trivia, world information, facts, history, all manner of things
        one
        might stumble across in life.<br> Most often this trait is used to gain extra context surrounding specific
        situations, or advantages on potentially difficult checks. One may think of this trait as hints or assistance.
        As it determines nothing beyond a character's access to relevant information that can be used to empower their
        other abilities.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Weight">Weight: </Span> The heaviness of an object or entity. Weight is context
        sensitive. The weight value of entities is a different measure than the weight of items.
        <br> In reference to entities;
        <br> <b>Weight 1:</b> Small human.
        <br> <b>Weight 2:</b> Underweight human.
        <br> <b>Weight 3:</b> Average <span>weight</span> human.
        <br> <b>Weight 4:</b> Overweight Human.
        <br> <b>Weight 5:</b> Massive Human.
        <br><br>* Elves, having hollow bones, are naturally lighter than humans (-1) of an equivalent build, while
        ogres are naturally heavier (+1).
        <br><br>Entity Weight is <b>not based on body fat.</b> It includes things like height and muscle mass as well.
        It's based to think of weight as <b>how big a character is,</b> whether that's height, width, or
        circumference.
        <br><br><b>Item weight</b> refers to the weight of weapons and items, generally this graded on the usual 1-5
        scale, but it can go higher when neccesary.
        <br> <b>Weight 1:</b> A baseball.
        <br> <b>Weight 2:</b> A hardcover Book.
        <br> <b>Weight 3:</b> A carpenter's hammer.
        <br> <b>Weight 4:</b> A car battery.
        <br> <b>Weight 5:</b> A manhole cover.
        <br><br>
        <div style="transform:scale(.9);">* <b>Carry weight:</b> Character's have two weight limits when it comes to
          holding items in their inventory. Pocket limits, and the character's carry limit.
          <br>When pockets are overweight, they are at risk of ripping.
          <br>When a character's carry limit is overweight, they gain +1 to their weight class, and -1 to their
          athleticism. This effect is amplified the more overweight the character is.
          <br>In extreme circumstances, endurance checks must be performed to avoid knee & back injuries.

        <b>all abilities. </b>All checks are<b> ability checks. </b> Abilities are any thing that your character can
        <b>do.</b> Infact, it wouldn't be wrong to say abilities are the core of a character, not traits, but of one's
        abilities, traits are the most
        fundnemental.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Skills">Skills: </Span> Abilities that require a certain physical fitness,
        coordination, body awareness, or that raise one's heartrate when performed. These are physical talents such as
        martial arts or dance.<br> Skills require SKL Cards to focus their checks, or to perform their class
        techniques.

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Insights">Insights: </Span> Abilities that require mental fortitude, a high level of
        education, or creative thinking. These are things a character is educated in, and has a great understanding

        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Classes">Classes: </Span> Specialized knowledge in a subject. Classes do not restrict a
        character, and they can have as many as they can find time to study. Technique Classes grat special Techniques
        for every rank, as well as class bonuses. Technique classes exist only for mechanical purposes for things such
        as combat and item & spell creation. For all other purposes access to class checks are the benefit, as class
        checks are always significantly more specific and tailored to certain tasks often producing much more
        favorable results.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Techniques">Techniques: </Span> techniques are special abilities that offer
        <b>mechanical</b> benefits to the character in contexts such as combat, item & spell creation, or that modify

        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Memory">Memory: </Span> Characters may only access abilities that they have <b>in
          memory.</b> On the Character Sheet, memory is indicated by clear, white slots, while forgotten slots are
        darker, and blurred.
        <br> Forgotten abilities will have their experience decay faster than one's in memory at midnight of every
        night. Abilities can freely be forgotten, but may only be moved back into memory once per hour upon a
        successful intelligence check.<br>
        <br> Memory is determined by one's Intelligence.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Bonuses">Bonuses: </Span> Modifiers applied to one's traits, raising or lowering them.
        Bonuses come in two forms, Trait Bonuses affect only a single trait, while Category bonuses affect all traits
        within a category, such as Mind, Body, Athleticism, or Awareness.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Experience">Experience: </Span> Experience in an ability determines at what point a
        character gains a new Rank, thus experience is only earned for classes and traits. <br> Successful ability
        checks award one point of experience, critical successes award two points, and passing checks with penalties
        award an aditional point for every penalty. <br> Checks will earn one less experience point for every
        advantage used. <br><br>* This means the maximum amount of experience that can be earned from one check is 5
        from a check for a rank 4 class, with three penalties, no advantages, and a pair of ones (1, 1).<br> This can
        then be multiplied by an intelligence check for a maximum total of 10 experience.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Satiety">Satiety: </Span> A measure of a character's basic needs. These needs are food,
        water, and sleep. satiety points, or <b>"Sat"</b> are spent to refill one's cards. this can be done at any
        time outside of combat. <br> It costs 1 sat to refill 1 card.<br>
        <br>Food sat is a measure of calories consumed, with 1 sat being the equivalent to approximately 100 calories.
        <br>Water sat is a measure of water consumed (Not liquid) with 1 sat being equivalent to 8 fluid ounces, or
        one cup.<br>Sleep sat is a measure of the hours one can remain comfortably awake, with 1 sat being equivalent
        to 1 hour, and every hour of sleep granting 2 sat.

        <br><br>* Actions can be performed to refill sat aside from the normal means, such as slapping yourself awake
        to regain some sleep sat.<br>
        <br> * During sleep abilities can be swapped in and out of memory freely. This effect ends upon waking up.

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Toxicity">Toxicity: </Span> The amountby which a character is affected by intoxicants.
        These include things like drugs, alcohol, and poisons, as well as the positive effects of potions, special

        <span class="Term" id="Time">Time: </Span> Every hour in <b>RATTRAPS</b> is played, from when a character
        wakes to when they sleep that night. <br> One hour in <b>RATTRAPS</b> is time enough for a character to
        accomplish two things. Whether that be two tasks, two complex steps in a large task, or hold a conversation
        that spans two topics in detail. <br> Every hour will drain a character's satiety, each by 1 sat, and progress
        the temperature. <br><Br> Temperature effects will occur <b>when the hour is passed.</b> Meaning if a
        character finds shelter before they pass the hour on their character sheet, they may avoid some of the harsh
        effects of exposure.<br><br> Every night at midnight, when the hour is passed, experience for all abilities
        will decay by one. Forgotten abilities will decay based on a percentage determined by their mind tratis.
        Consecutive hours spent in the elements will also build to certain effects, such as one's cloths becoming
        saturated with sweat in the heat, or water in intense humidity.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Temperature">Temperature: </Span> The current heat of the outdoors, determined by the
        region's climate, and daily weather conditions. <br> The temperature fluctuates every hour, but days will
        always be hottest near noon, and coldest near midnight.<br>
        <br> Character's reaction to the temperature is determined by their constitution, but they can further protect
        themselves from extreem heat or cold by wearing suitable clothes. <b>All clothes increase a character's
          insulation,</b> making them warmer, thus removing clothes can make one cooler. Certain specialized garments
        can also make one cooler in particularly hot climates. <br><br>Always dress for the weather!
        <br><br>* The <b>Context Modifier</b> is a slider located at the top of the character sheet that strongly
        adjusts the temperature. this is used when a character has entered a context that overrides the natural
        temperature. Such contexts include sitting beside a fire, being indoors, swimming, or magical effects.
        <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Humidity">Humidity: </Span> The amount of water held in the air. Humidity when too high
        or low will cause special effects on those who are exposed for too many hours, such as nose bleeds, or cracked
        lips when it's too dry, or sweating & saturation when it's too wet. <br><br> Daily humidity is also one of two
        determining factors for rain, which is more common when the water content in the air is higher.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Wind">Wind: </Span> The natural movement of air. Wind has a cooling effect that is
        unique from that of temperatures. Wind cools the body by passsing through the clothes, and replacing the
        insulated air, with new cold air. Thus to protect one's self from the wind, Clothing with a high resistance to
        absorbance is neccessry.
        <br><br>
        * Spells that generate force also create wind as a byproduct, and thus can be used to create cooling effects.

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Rain">Rain: </Span> When the day's forecast check passes both humidity and wind, it
        will rain for that hour. Rain is more common when both wind and humidity in the region is high. Functionally
        rain lasts for only one hour, but when conditions are right, multiple consecutive hours can have rain, when
        this occurs, the G.M. can use other attributes in the forcast to decide the strength of the storm as well as
        any world affects it may have such as floods or landslides (Which may also be used as tarot encounters).

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Files">Files: </Span> Over the course of a run, characters may collect written
        information in the form of notes, books, diaries, and letters. These are items that may need to be referenced
        several times over the course of a run and thus, their contents will be tracked in the "Files" section on the
        character's sheet.<br> These entries can be expanded by the G.M. as more information is gained from the same
        source.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Notes">Notes: </Span> During a character's journey through a run, they will be exposed
        to many details, characters, and places. <b>RATTRAPS</b> has no "Story" Or "Plot", every run follows the
        decisions and exploits of it's cast. For this reason it's reccomended that both directing players and G.M.
        keep detailed notes on relavant information and mysteries with desireable answers.
        <br>To this end, every character's sheet has a notes section.
        <br><br>* This section is also where quirks are to be noted for the G.M.'s reference.

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Weapons">Weapons: </Span> A weapon is any item held with offensive intent. These items
        are used to amplify a character's offensive power, and focus them into stronger attacks.
        <br><br> Weapons come primarily in two forms;
        <br><b>Melee:</b> Swords, axes, spears, etc. that attack to a specic consistent range, and are powered by the
        acting character's ability.

        <br><br><b>Ranged:</b> Bows, slings, firearms, etc. that have no hard limit to the distance at which they can
        land attacks, and are powered by mechanisms contained within the weapon.

        <br><br>All weapons concentrate a character's abilities through their "weapon stats". These include;
        <br>- Sharpness
        <br>- Range
        <br>- Balance
        <br>- Shape
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Attacks">Attacks: </Span> Offensive actions with the intent to cause harm to another
        entity.
        <br> When performing an attack, characters will need to perform two rolls, first <b>Target,</b> and then
        <b>To-Hit.</b> <br>
        <br>The Target roll <b>is not a check.</b> It simply determines what locations on the target are most
        available to be struck. In the case of mundane creatures, one dice is used to represent the limb while the
        other represents the spot on that limb. Which is which is up to the discretion of the directing player.
        Character's can use focus to target less armored, or more vulnerable spots on their opponent.
        <br><br> Then the acting character will perform their To-Hit roll. This roll determines <b>if</b> and <b>how
          hard</b> the character will land their attack.
        <br>This check is performed using a relavant offensive ability class or Dexterity with a penalty.
        <br><br>- If this check passes, the attack will land at the intended power.
        <br>- If the check passes with a pair, the damage dealt will be doubled.
        <br><br> If the check fails, melee weapons will deal half damage, while ranged weapons will miss to a degree
        equal to how badly the check failed.
        <br><br> If the check fails with a pair, melee weapons will miss entirely, and leave the acting character
        destabilized for the moment, while ranged attacks will miss severely, striking the worst available mark.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Grapple">Grappling: </Span> The act of one character physically restraining or
        wrestling another entity into submission.<br> When two entities enter a grapple they most both roll, the sum
        of both dice, their strength, and their weight, determines their <b>grapple advantage.</b>
        <br>This means <b>heavier, stronger</b> characters will be more difficult to win grapples against.
        <br><br>* Having certain ability classes can be used as an additional grapple advantage, but these advantages
        will alway be worth <b>1</b> regarcless of rank.<br> Only Grappling Classes may add their full rank to a

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Power-Lvl">Attack Power: </Span> The intended force put into an attack. This value

        <br>Level 2: 1 recovery, reduced damage.
        <br>Level 3: 2 recovery, full damage.
        <br>Level 4: 3 recovery, increased damage.
        <br>Level 5: 4 recovery, double damage.
        <br><Br> Recovery moments are moments in a round when the acting character is commited to the attack, and
        <b>cannot perform any actions.</b> These are les severe on characters with high speed, as their actions take
        less time than those of slower characters.
        <br> The structure of an attack, where recovery & hit moments fall is decided by the directing player, but
        recovery moments <b>must</b> me adjacent to their hit moment.
        <br><br>
        <div style="transform:scale(.9);">* Power Levels only apply to melee attacks. Ranged weapons all have their

        <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Hit-Moment">Hit Moments: </Span> The moment in a round when a melee attack lands. This
        moment must be surrounded by any necessary recovery moments. If the hit moments of two attacking characters
        overlap, the attacks will clash, with the stronger attack parrying the weaker one, destabilizing that attacker.
        relative to how much stronger the winning attack was.
        <br><br>* Certain techniques can be performed out of these clashes to avoid the risk of being parried.

        <br><br>* A character's resistance to being parried is determined by their Speed.

        <br><br>* Even when parried or destabilized, characters can escape treacherous situations using the free
        technique
        <b>scramble.</b>

        <div style="transform:scale(.9);">* The hit moment of ranged attacks is determined by the distance to the
          target.
          Attacks within the <b>flat</b> effective range of a ranged weapon will land the moment they are fired. for
          every
          multiple of a weapon's flat effective range away the hit-moment will advance one moment later.
          <br><br> For example: If a bow's effective range is 10 spaces, and the target is 30 spaces away when the
          attack
          is fired. the hit moment is two moments later.
          <br><br>* Projectile use speed 5 moments, regardless of the acting character's abilities.

        <span class="Term" id="DT">Damage Threshold: </Span> The maximum damage that can be absorbed by something before
        it breaks. The amount of damage that is reduced by clothing & armor is a portion of it's DT. When recieving
        damage, if the damage dealt to a piece of armor is greater than it's DT, the armor is destroyed at that spot.
        It's
        DT will be subtracted from the damage value and, and the new damage value will be dealt to the layers beneath.
        <br><br>* only when armor is broken will it lend it's <b>full DT</b> to stopping the attack that broke it. This
        is
        an armor piece's desperate attempt to defend it's wearer, and the wearer's final warning before things get
        dangerous.
        <br> All items have a DT, because all things can be broken given enough force. DT is determined by the material
        &
        construction of an item. It is immutable unless through magic, or mechanical reinforcement.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="PD">Padding: </Span> The portion of an armor piece's DT that will <b>always reduce
          incoming
          damage.</b> This is determined by the amor's construction. A crude metal plate is difficult to break, but
        easily
        transmits force through it, while padded jackets are easy to pierce, but absorb force well.
        <Br> Due to this, proper armor should be layered, with padding protected under high a high DT outerlayer.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Deflection">Deflection: </Span>Certain types of armor encourage incoming attacks to
        deflect. Most often this is due to it's curved, or grooved shapes. An armor's deflection rating is added as
        penalties to the incoming attack's To-Hit roll. The attack will also gain an additional penlalty for every rank
        of
        sharpness the weapon has above 3.<br>
        Blunt weapons nullify deflection based on how far from 3 Sharpness they are. Meaning a weapon with sharpness 1
        can
        ignore two points of DT.

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Balance">Balance: </Span> How a melee weapon holds it's weight. Specifically, "balance"
        refers to the amount of weight a weapon holds at it's base, while "Weight" in <b>this context</b> is the weight
        held at the end of it's effective range.
        <br>A higher "weight" means higher damage swinging attacks, as well as more penalties when trying to focus
        thrusting attacks.
        <br>Generally you want a swinging weapon with a high "weight", and thrusting weapons to have high balance.

        <span class="Term" id="Sharpness">Sharpness: </Span> The degree to which force will be focused & amplified.
        Sharpness comes in two forms, Edge and Point. Edge sharpness is used for swinging attacks, while point is used
        for
        thrusting attacks. The benefit of sharpness is amplified by a character's dexterity, having both high will
        result
        in incredibly damaging attacks. However high sharpness also increases the chance for deflection, as every point
        of
        sharpness above three adds a penalty to the To-Hit roll of attacks targeting armor with the Deflection property,
        while blunt weapons will nullify deflection by adding advantages relative to how low their sharpness is.
        <br>Sharpness is lowered when a weapon is chipped too many times, and raised when sharpened by an entity.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Chips">Chips: </Span> Whenever a weapon absorbs damage equal to half it's DT, it will
        recieve a chip. When the number of chips is equal to the weapon's Retention the weapon's sharpness is lowered.
        <br>The chips for edge and point sharpness are tracked seperately, thus it's possible to dull the edge of a
        sword,
        while it's point remains razor sharp.
        <br>Chips may be removed through regular maintenence of a weapon.
        <br><br>* Chips may also be added when a weapon is mistreated in someway.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Retention">Retention: </Span>The ability of a material to hold it's shape, and resist
        chipping. Retention determines the number of chips a weapon can recieve before it's relavant sharpness is
        dulled.
        Retention like DT is a property of the material the weapon is made of, and thus cannot be modified except
        through
        magic or mechanical reinforcement.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Length">Length: </Span> The literal length of a weapon, it's maximum reach. Length is
        <b>always</b> the range used for thrusting attacks, unless modified by special techniques.
        <br> Length however, is seperate from effective range, and it's possible for an attack to deal reduced damage
        for
        landing at the end of it's length, <b>beyond it's effective range.</b>
        <br><br>* Certain weapons may use their length as the effective range for thrusting attacks, while the range
        value
        is used for swinging attacks.
        <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Range">Range: </Span> A melee weapon's effective range determines whether or not it will
        deal it's full damage or not. attacks that land on targets too close, or too far will have their damage reduced
        relative to how far away from the "sweet spot" the target is when the attack lands. For this reason it may be
        preferable to rush in on opponent's equipped with long weapons in order to reduce the incoming damage as much as
        possible.
        <br><br>A Ranged Weapon doesn't have a "sweet spot" and will always deal it's intended damage to the target,
        unless deflected. All ranged weapons have ranges that determine the distance a target can be before incurring a
        target penalty. Ranged weapons can attack to any distance beyond their effective range, but will incur more
        penalties the further the target is.
        <br><Br>* The effective range of bot melee and ranged weapons can be modified by certain techniques.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Shape-Mod.">Shape Modifier: </Span> Certain weapons are designed to impart a mechanical
        advantage to swinging or thrusting attacks. These amplify the damage dealt my the relavant attack type.
        <br>Shape modifiers are based on the structure of a weapon, and cannot be modified without changing the weapon's
        shape through magic of mechanical means.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Item">Items: </Span> Any object that can be carried. Items include tools, weapons, armor
        &
        clothing articles, and any object one might squirrel away in their pockets.
        <br>Items are kept in a character's inventory and can serve nearly any purpose.
        <Br>The two most common use of items, is as aid in combat, in the form of bombs, traps, buffs, or debuffs, and
        for
        context advantages, such as notes, books, tools, etc.
        <br>In combat

        <span class="Term" id="Combat">Combat: </Span> The use of violence to achieve moral or strategic goals. Combat
        begins when <b>any entity</b> submits a Battle Ticket to the G.M.. This character will get the first round of
        combat all to themselves. After this first round, all involved entities will denote their actions on their
        battle
        tickets, and once all neccesary tickets are submitted to the G.M., all actions will occur simultaneously.
        <br>Combat lasts until the directing player requests it to end, however this means that other entites may turn
        in
        another ticket to gain a free first round to act. So exercise caution.
        <br>It's best to only end combat when one is sure all their enemies are dead, restrained, routed, or
        surrendering.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Battle-Ticket">Battle-Ticket: </Span> A list of actions to be taken in the current round
        of
        combat. The battle ticket <B>must</b> be submitted to the G.M. <b>before</b> the results of the round can be
        narrated. The only exception to this rule being when a character spends an insight card to submit a partial
        ticket.
        <br>When submitting a partial ticket, characters may submit actions only up to certain breakpoints denoted by
        the
        alternating colors of the actions on one's character's sheet.
        <br>This allows a directing player to see what happens in the set moments before commiting to the rest of their
        ticket.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Round">Round: </Span> One "turn" of combat, or one set of battle tickets. Every round is
        seperated into moments, upon which actions may be taken. At the end of every round damage will be sustained from
        any lesser bleed stacks on involved entities. If the damage sustained causes any entity's HP to reach zero, they
        will be downed.
        <br><br>* Every round lasts roughly 10 seconds.
