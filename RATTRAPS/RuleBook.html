      To live is to know the internal <span>experience</span>, or perhaps its structure, which created all those who
      came
      before us, and all who will come after. The <b>Human <span>Experience</span></b> is alike between individuals.
      Through the
      assumption of roles (or characters ) we can learn to better understand ourselves, and our peers with whom we share
      this life, it's beauties, and it's sorrows. <br><br>
      <span style="display:block;text-align:center;">This is the purpose behind <b>RATTRAPS</b>.</span><br><br>
      <b>RATTRAPS</b> is a role play system designed with realism at the forefront. As such, all systems have been
      derived from their scientific and historical counterparts. <br>
      In service of this, <span class="Term" id="Argument">The Rule of Argument</span> supersedes all others. This
      is the principle that; <b>If an argument can be made sound, the action may be allowed.</b> The G.M. will have
      final say in determining what constitutes a sound argument, but if, using logical principles and historical
      president, a directing player can satisfactorily articulate that a certain feat should be possible. This will
      override any rule herein.<br>
      The purpose of <b>RATTRAPS</b> is ultimately the simulation of reality, for the purpose of exploring characters.
      Thus the <b>rules</b> are always subordinate to the <b>logic</b> that was used to create them. <br>
      <br>This rule also helps as a directing player's balance against the fallible G.M. and helps to ensure a fair
      representation of their character.

      <b id="Game-Flow">RATTRAPS</b>
      is most commonly played via correspondence, with each directing player in isolation from one another. this
      preserves anonymity, and allows players to immerse themselves fully in their character's thought process and
      decision making style absent the social pressures of a party, or group. <br>
      Betrayers betray, thieves steal, and villains must commit villainy. The only punishment to be faced for realizing
      your character well, are to be dealt unto the character in the form of reactions from the word and it's
      inhabitants, including other characters directed by other players.
      Communities are policed, murders are investigated, and crimes are punished via a judicial systems and
      avengers.<br>
      One should not hold back from themselves for the sake of others.
      <br><br>
      Players will take turns with their G.M., with the players directing their characters in response to the
      developments provided from the G.M.. <br>
      Players will be assisted in tracking their character's needs and abilities using their character sheet.<br>
      <br>This forms the basic structure of the game.<br><br>
      Below will be listed, in detail, all the terms, and mechanics that will be used in the course of a run.

      <div class="header">
        <span class="Subdivision">-General-</span><br>

        <span class="Term" id="G.M.">Game Manager: </Span> The player responsible for rendering the game world, and
        directing NPCs. This player also will narrate the unconscious thoughts of player characters. These thoughts will
        <b>never</b> affect their decision making or personality, but will give their directing players a better
        understanding of their character's physical and mental state. For example the remnant feelings of pain from a
        past
        injury, or the sensations caused by failed checks are within the realm of the game manager's control, not the
        directing player.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Direction">Direction: </Span> <i style="text-decoration:underline;">You are not your
          character.</i> in <b>RATTRAPS</b>
        characters have their own skillsets & abilities that they'll have to use in order to solve their problems. These
        abilities are often times unequal to the directing player's own faculties, thus it is better to approach your
        character not from the mindset of <i>"controlling"</i> them, but rather you are "<i>directing</i>" their
        actions.
        <br> They are their own person, and you are aiding them along, immersing yourself in their life.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Player">Player: </Span> There exist two kinds of players in <b>RATTRAPS</b>; One is the
        G.M. while the others all direct their own individual characters. The generic term players most often refers to
        the latter kind.<br>
        It is the job of <i>these</i> players to immerse themselves in the role of their characters, and embody their
        personalities when directing their actions. <br>
        Players are <b>not</b> expected to cooperate, or ally themselves with one another. In fact this behavior is
        discouraged if it would compromise the character's own way of thinking.<br>
        To this end it is recommended that players maintain their anonymity during a run. Not knowing what player is
        directing what character helps to ensure authentic interactions and prevents interpersonal tensions.
        <i>You are not your characters.</i><br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Character">Character: </Span> Each player will create their own character. These can be
        anyone, accountants, adventurers, soldiers, villains, royalty, <i>anyone</i>. These characters will be defined
        by
        their traits & abilities as well as by the <i>personality</i> that their directing player chooses to give
        them.<br>
        Players will direct their character until the run ends, or until the character retires, or dies.<br> These
        characters, and their interactions, are the backbone of <b>RATTRAPS</b>. It is through them that we can learn
        about ourselves, and the peers we share this life with.<br>
        Players will be aided in the management of their characters by their character sheets, which contain all manner
        of
        helpful & necessary functions. <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="NPC">Non-Player Characters: </Span> It is the G.M.'s responsibility to fill the game
        world
        with interesting <i>"NPCs"</i> for the main cast to interact with. These will include the local citizenry, law
        enforcement, rivals, allies, enemies, and any other necessary persons to give the world its depth.<br>
        During the character creation process, players may request that the G.M. direct NPC companions for their
        character. This can be a massive advantage, as well as a great enhancement to one's story through the run.
        <br>
        NPCs can also be generated at random through the Tarot system. <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Cast">Cast: </Span> The cast refers collectively to all player characters. As these
        characters have the full creative attention of their directing players behind them, they will easily be the most
        interesting entities in any given run, as well as most likely to drive its plot forward.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Char-Sheet">Character Sheet: </Span> A player's character sheet is their most important
        resource. It tracks experience, satiety, HP, statuses, inventory, time of day, all critical to the direction of
        one's character. Below is a list of sections that can be found on one's character sheet.<br><br>
        Traits <br>
        Abilities <br>
        Satiety & Time <br>
        Temperature <br>
        Files <br>
        Notes <br>
        Weapon <br>
        Battle Ticket <br>
        Wellbeing <br>
        Maps <br>
        Inventory <br>
        Tack <br>
        Resistances <br>
        Armor Grids <br>
        Storage <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Run">Run: </Span> <b>RATTRAPS</b> centers around the interconnected stories of its Cast.
        <b>There is no goal in RATTRAPS.</b> Instead these stories and wander and weave in and out of each other as each
        character pursues their own individual goals.<br> Runs are primarily defined by the creative team behind them.
        This includes the G.M. as well as all the involved players.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Context">Context: </Span> The term "Context" Is used to refer to advantages, bonuses, and
        modifiers derived from the relavant character's <b>current situation.</b>
        <br> For example, a <b>Context Advantage</b> is an advantage that exists only due to the character's current
        situation, such as having access to written instructions on how to perform a task, being assisted by a character
        with relavant knowledge, or having the correct tools for the job.
        <br><br>* The complexity of a task, whether something is easy or difficult from the relavant approach, is also a
        "contextual advantage" though these sorts of modifiers are solely the responsibility of the G.M.
        <br>
      </div>

      <div class="header">
        <span class="Subdivision">-Mechanics-</span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Checks">Checks: </Span> Whenever a character's abilities are tested, a check is
        performed. The player will roll a pair of standard seven-sum dice. If the <b>lower</b> of the <span>die</span>
        is <b>equal to or less than</b> the check's bar, then the check <b>succeeds</b> granting a favorable outcome to
        performing character. <br>If both dice are <b>greater than</b> the bar, then the check <b>fails</b> granting the
        character a negative outcome.<br>
        Should both rolled <span>die</span> show the <b>same</b> number (A pair), the result is considered critical.<br>
        <br> The bar for checks can be raised by advantages and will be lowered penalties. Unfavorable rolls can be
        adjusted using the focus mechanic.<br>
        <br> Ability checks come in three forms;
        <br> <b>Flat checks </b>will ignore all penalties & advantages, and cannot be focused.
        <br><b>Passive Checks </b> which will be rolled by the G.M. without informing the directing player. As such
        these cannot be focused either.
        <br><b>Active Checks</b> Which are performed at will by directing players. <br>
        <br> The G.M. will <b>always</b> inform players whenever a passive check has been performed on behalf of their
        character, but players will <b>not</b> be informed if <b>any</b> of their checks succeed or fail. This is to
        ensure authenticity in the character's reaction to their own attempts.<br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="50-50">50-50: </Span> A less common style of check, used primarily by the G.M., in which
        a single dice is rolled with all odd numbers representing one option, and all even numbers representing a
        second.<br> These are most often used to make quick determinations in situations with two acceptable outcomes,
        and rarely will be used to make decisions of true importance.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Bar">Bar: </Span> The highest number a character can roll to pass an ability check. If
        the tested ability's rank is 3, the character <b>must roll a 3 or below</b> to pass.<br>
        The bar of checks is always modified by the total number of penalties & advantages applied to it.<br>
        <br> Players will often need to estimate what the bar is for their checks based on the situation, and their
        character. One advantage will cancel out one penalty.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Advantage">Advantages: </Span> Advantages are anything that makes an ability check
        <b>easier</b> for the performing character.<br>
        For example; were a character to attempt to leap across a gap in the floor, having footwear that grants extra
        traction would be an advantage in their favor. The floor being level and even, with no obstructions, would be
        another advantage.<br> Since <b>each advantage raises the bar by 1</b> the hypothetical check above would have
        it's bar raised by 2, making it <b>significantly</b> easier to pass.<br>
        <br> Advantages such as the ones used in the above example, that are derived from the current situation, are
        referred to as <b>Contextual Advantages</b>. These can be stacked with any incumbent advantages to greatly
        reduce the risk faced by the performing character, so be sure to always consider your situation carefully before
        rolling. <br>
        <br> Every advantage on a passed check will decrease the exp earned for passing by 1.</b><br> In the event that
        an ability class or technique is used as an advantage in a check, experience lost will be awarded to the
        <b>first class advantage noted.</b><br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Penalty">Penalties: </Span> Penalties are anything that makes an ability check <b>more
          difficult</b> for the performing character.<br> For example; were a character to attempt reading a dense
        academic book, dim lighting would be a penalty. Were the character on a bumpy wagon ride, the erratic motions
        would be another penalty.<br>
        Since <b>each penalty lowers the bar by 1</b> the hypothetical check above would have its bar decreased by 2,
        making it <b>significantly</b> more difficult to pass.<br>
        <br> Penalties such as the ones used in the above example, that are derived from the current situation, are
        referred to as <b>Contextual Penalties</b>. These will be <span>stacked</span> with any incumbent penalties to
        greatly increase the difficulty faced by the performing character. Be sure to always consider your situation
        carefully before rolling. <br>
        <br><b>The G.M. will not inform players of contextual penalties when they are performing a check.</b><br>Always
        exercise your own caution when directing characters.<br>
        <br> Every penalty on a passed check will increase the exp earned for passing by 1.</b><br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Incumbents">Incumbents: </Span> Any trait or ability that's rank is <b>not</b> 3, has
        incumbent advantages if it's higher, and incumbent penalties if it's lower. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Rank 1:</b> 2 penalties<br>
        <b>Rank 2:</b> 1 penalties.<br>
        ⭡ ⭡ ⭡<br>
        <b style="text-decoration:underline;">Rank 3:</b> No incumbents.<br>
        ⭣ ⭣ ⭣<br>
        <b>Rank 4:</b> 1 advantages.<br>
        <b>Rank 5:</b> 2 advantages. <br>
        <br>
        <br> These are representative of
        your mastery (<i>Or lack thereof</i>) of the ability in question. <br> Incumbent advantages & penalties will
        still modify the experience earned from checks. Meaning it's <b>more difficult</b> to earn experience for high
        rank abilities, as they require more difficult checks to earn experience.<br><br>Incumbents are lost and earned
        naturally as a character progresses through ranks. <b>all abilities</b> are affected by incumbents. <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Quirks">Quirks: </Span> During character creation, when setting their trait ranks,
        Players can choose to replace incumbent advantages or penalties with positive or negative quirks related to the
        trait in question.<br>
        Penalties <b>must</b> be replaced with <b>negative</b> quirks, while penalties <b>must</b> be replaced with
        <b>positive</b> quirks.<br> Quirks are in essence, niche advantages & penalties, that are unlikely to affect all
        your checks, but due to their nature may affect checks for more than just the trait they're under. <br>For
        example; A character might choose arachnophobia as a Wisdom Quirk. They will no longer need to overcome their
        incumbent Penalty, but will have to deal with more severe penalties when around spiders, or things that remind
        them of spiders.<br><br> Quirks can be used to turn Penalties into advantages through their unintended side
        effects. Another example; A character might choose to take paranoia as a negative Perception Quirk. This might
        cause unnecessary checks, but would also grant advantages in the event of a real threat. More frequent checks
        would also lead to more experience gained.<br><br> Unlike incumbents, Quirks do not disappear as one raises
        their trait ranks. When an incumbent penalty is replaced with a negative quirk, that quirk is kept indefinitely.
        Whenever a character raises a Quirked trait rank, the directing player may choose <b>not to raise their rank</b>
        in order to remove their negative quirk.<br><br>
        Quirks can also be gained or lost rarely through developments in a character's personal story.
        <br><br>* Quirks are to be listed and briefly explained in the notes section of one's character sheet for the
        G.M.'s reference.
        <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Seven-Sum">Seven-Sum Dice: </Span> <b>RATTRAPS</b> is played using two standard Seven-Sum
        Dice. This means that opposite faces will always add up to seven. (Five is opposite two, six is opposite
        one.)<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Focus">Focus: </Span> Characters can modify <b>any</b> dice roll using the relevant
        trait. Dex is used to focus skill rolls, while Wisdom is used to focus insight rolls.<br><br> When focusing a
        roll, the either dice maybe raised or lowered by one, as many times as the performing character has ranks in the
        relevant trait.<br><br>

        Focusing a roll costs one card of relevant type.<br>
        <br>* Focus <b>cannot be used</b> on any roll that resulted in a <b>pair of 6s.</b><br>

        <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Rank">Rank: </Span> A character's talent in any given trait or class. Ranks determine the
        natural bar of checks which become easier as Ranks increase, as well as that ability's incumbents.<br> Trait
        Ranks also determine a character's access to quirks while technique class ranks often provide class bonuses that
        grow in effectiveness with higher ranks.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Traits">Traits: </Span> The fundamental abilities that define a character. Traits are
        generic, and widely applicable abilities. Like all abilities, they receive incumbents, but unlike skills &
        insights, the incumbents of traits can be traded for Quirks to further specialize a character.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Strength">Strength: </Span> A measure of a character's ability to move and carry weight.
        Strength determines how much of a load they can carry, what objects they can lift, and what weapons they have

        grappling exchanges, where strength is added to their grapple check, making foes easier to deal with.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Dexterity">Dexterity: </Span> A measure of a character's fine motor <span>skills</span>.
        Dexterity
        determines their effectiveness with edged weapons, how likely they are to be disarmed, as well as how many
        actions they're able to perform in one round of combat. <br> Dexterity is extremely useful for finer actions,
        such as playing instruments, writing, and Precision striking.<br><br> Dexterity is also the trait used to focus
        skill rolls and checks.<br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Speed">Speed: </Span> A measure of a character's gross motor <span>skills</span> and
        coordination. Speed determines they melee damage, How likely they are to recover from being destabilized,

        combat.<br> When it comes to
        combat,<b> Speed is the most important trait.</b><br>
        <br> Athleticism and its subordinate traits are considered to be skills.

        <span class="Term" id="Perception">Perception: </Span> A measure of a character's situational awareness and
        the
        acuity of their sense. Perception determines how much detail they can perceive in their environment, how easy
        it
        is to visually target objects & entities with ranged weapons & magic, and how much of their battle ticket
        *must*
        be turned in at a time. <br> For cautious characters, or those interested in gathering detail from the
        environment, perception is very important.<br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Navigation">Navigation: </Span> A measure of a character's spacial awareness and their
        ease of orienting themselves in space. Navigation determines a character's ability to avoid getting lost or

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Charisma">Charisma: </Span> A measure of a character's social awareness, and their
        ability to understand the social cues & meanings behind the words of others. For social characters, charisma

        <span class="Term" id="Stamina">Stamina: </Span> A measure of a character's physical fitness, and how well
        they can ignore physical discomfort. Stamina primarily determines the maximum number of skill cards a
        character has access to,
        and thus, how often they can use techniques or focus.<br><br>* Stmaina checks can be used to resist
        discomfort, or prolong actions beyond when they should normally end. Forcing yourself through something

        <span class="Term" id="Constitution">Constitution: </Span> A measure of the efficiency with which a
        character's body operates, and how difficult it is to disturb those operations. Constitution determines a
        character's
        natural damage reduction, their DP, their temperature tolerance, and their toxic resistance.<br><br>A
        character
        with high constitution will also have a much easier time keeping themselves composed in stressful
        circumstances,
        such as being startled.<br><br>* Constitution is used to <b>passively resist</b> involuntary reactions, such

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Mind">Mind: </Span> A category of traits that, together, offer an idea of a character's
        mental prowess. These traits represent a character's ability to think and problem solve, these tend to be very
        important for investigative characters. <br> Mind includes Intelligence, Knowledge, and Wisdom.<br><br> Mind
        and
        its subordinate traits
        are considered to be Insights. <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Intelligence">Intelligence: </Span> A measure of the efficiency with which a
        character's
        mind operates, its clarity and quickness. Intelligence determines how many abilities can be held in memory,
        how
        difficult it is to retrieve forgotten abilities, and how well a character can process information.
        Intelligence
        also determines one's ability to perform mental functions, such as arithmetic.
        <br>
        <br>* Intelligence Checks can be used to double the experience gained from previous checks.<br>
        <br> * During sleep abilities can be swapped in and out of memory freely. This effect ends upon waking up.
        <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Wisdom">Wisdom: </Span> A measure of a character's ability to think in abstract terms,
        grasp deeper concepts, and their creativity. Wisdom determines the maximum potency of cast spells, how
        difficult
        it is to modify one's spells, as well as a character's aptitude for logical reasoning, and critical thinking.
        Art appreciation, riddles, and philosophy are all within the realm of Wisdom.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Knowledge">Knowledge: </Span> A measure of the vastness of generic information kept in
        a
        character's mind at all times. This includes trivia, world information, facts, history, all manner of things
        one
        might stumble across in life.<br> Most often this trait is used to gain extra context surrounding specific
        situations, or advantages on potentially difficult checks. One may think of this trait as hints or assistance.
        As it determines nothing beyond a character's access to relevant information that can be used to empower their
        other abilities.<br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Weight">Weight: </Span> The heaviness of an object or entity. Weight is context
        sensitive. The weight value of entities is a different measure than the weight of items.
        <br> In reference to entities;
        <br> <b>Weight 1:</b> Small human.
        <br> <b>Weight 2:</b> Underweight human.
        <br> <b>Weight 3:</b> Average <span>weight</span> human.
        <br> <b>Weight 4:</b> Overweight Human.
        <br> <b>Weight 5:</b> Massive Human.
        <br><br>* Elves, having hollow bones, are naturally lighter than humans (-1) of an equivalent build, while
        ogres are naturally heavier (+1).
        <br><br>Entity Weight is <b>not based on body fat.</b> It includes things like height and muscle mass as well.
        It's based to think of weight as <b>how big a character is,</b> whether that's height, width, or
        circumference.
        <br><br><b>Item weight</b> refers to the weight of weapons and items, generally this graded on the usual 1-5
        scale, but it can go higher when neccesary.
        <br> <b>Weight 1:</b> A baseball.
        <br> <b>Weight 2:</b> A hardcover Book.
        <br> <b>Weight 3:</b> A carpenter's hammer.
        <br> <b>Weight 4:</b> A car battery.
        <br> <b>Weight 5:</b> A manhole cover.
        <br><br>
        <div class="Note">* <b>Carry weight:</b> Character's have two weight limits when it comes to
          holding items in their inventory. Pocket limits, and the character's carry limit.
          <br>When pockets are overweight, they are at risk of ripping.
          <br>When a character's carry limit is overweight, they gain +1 to their weight class, and -1 to their
          athleticism. This effect is amplified the more overweight the character is.
          <br>In extreme circumstances, endurance checks must be performed to avoid knee & back injuries.

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Classes">Classes: </Span> Specialized knowledge in a subject. Classes do not restrict a
        character, and they can have as many as they can find time to study. Technique Classes grat special Techniques
        for every rank, as well as class bonuses. Technique classes exist only for mechanical purposes for things such
        as combat and item & spell creation. For all other purposes access to class checks are the benefit, as class
        checks are always significantly more specific and tailored to certain tasks often producing much more
        favorable results.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Techniques">Techniques: </Span> techniques are special abilities that offer

        <span class="Term" id="Memory">Memory: </Span> Characters may only access abilities that they have <b>in
          memory.</b> On the Character Sheet, memory is indicated by clear, white slots, while forgotten slots are
        darker, and blurred.
        <br> Forgotten abilities will have their experience decay faster than one's in memory at midnight of every
        night. Abilities can freely be forgotten, but may only be moved back into memory once per hour upon a
        successful intelligence check.<br>
        <br> Memory is determined by one's Intelligence.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Bonuses">Bonuses: </Span> Modifiers applied to one's traits, raising or lowering them.
        Bonuses come in two forms, Trait Bonuses affect only a single trait, while Category bonuses affect all traits

        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Experience">Experience: </Span> Experience in an ability determines at what point a
        character gains a new Rank, thus experience is only earned for classes and traits. <br> Successful ability
        checks award one point of experience, critical successes award two points, and passing checks with penalties
        award an aditional point for every penalty. <br> Checks will earn one less experience point for every
        advantage used. <br><br>* This means the maximum amount of experience that can be earned from one check is 5
        from a check for a rank 4 class, with three penalties, no advantages, and a pair of ones (1, 1).<br> This can
        then be multiplied by an intelligence check for a maximum total of 10 experience.

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Satiety">Satiety: </Span> A measure of a character's basic needs. These needs are food,
        water, and sleep. satiety points, or <b>"Sat"</b> are spent to refill one's cards. this can be done at any
        time outside of combat. <br> It costs 1 sat to refill 1 card.<br>
        <br>Food sat is a measure of calories consumed, with 1 sat being the equivalent to approximately 100 calories.
        <br>Water sat is a measure of water consumed (Not liquid) with 1 sat being equivalent to 8 fluid ounces, or
        one cup.<br>Sleep sat is a measure of the hours one can remain comfortably awake, with 1 sat being equivalent
        to 1 hour, and every hour of sleep granting 2 sat.

        <br><br>* Actions can be performed to refill sat aside from the normal means, such as slapping yourself awake
        to regain some sleep sat.<br>
        <br> * During sleep abilities can be swapped in and out of memory freely. This effect ends upon waking up.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Sleep">Sleep: </Span> Sleep is a neccesary resource for all mundane creatures, and is one
        of three forms of Satiety. When a character's sleep satiety drops below half it's maximum, they are able to fall
        asleep with no penalities. Attempting to sleep while awake, or under certain effects requires a stamina check
        which, if failed, will result in the character being unable to sleep for another hour.
        <br> When a character falls asleep, it's directing player will roll to determine how long the character will
        sleep comfortably. The sum of the roll can be focused using the character's con at no cost.
        <br>Sleeping characters are vulnerable. They are incabable of acting, or defending themselves, until they are
        awoken.

        wakes to when they sleep that night. <br> One hour in <b>RATTRAPS</b> is time enough for a character to
        accomplish two things. Whether that be two tasks, two complex steps in a large task, or hold a conversation
        that spans two topics in detail. <br> Every hour will drain a character's satiety, each by 1 sat, and progress
        the temperature. <br><Br> Temperature effects will occur <b>when the hour is passed.</b> Meaning if a

        effects of exposure.<br><br> Every night at midnight, when the hour is passed, experience for all abilities
        will decay by one. Forgotten abilities will decay based on a percentage determined by their mind tratis.
        Consecutive hours spent in the elements will also build to certain effects, such as one's cloths becoming

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Temperature">Temperature: </Span> The current heat of the outdoors, determined by the
        region's climate, and daily weather conditions. <br> The temperature fluctuates every hour, but days will
        always be hottest near noon, and coldest near midnight.<br>
        <br> Character's reaction to the temperature is determined by their constitution, but they can further protect
        themselves from extreem heat or cold by wearing suitable clothes. <b>All clothes increase a character's
          insulation,</b> making them warmer, thus removing clothes can make one cooler. Certain specialized garments
        can also make one cooler in particularly hot climates. <br><br>Always dress for the weather!
        <br><br>* The <b>Context Modifier</b> is a slider located at the top of the character sheet that strongly
        adjusts the temperature. this is used when a character has entered a context that overrides the natural
        temperature. Such contexts include sitting beside a fire, being indoors, swimming, or magical effects.

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Humidity">Humidity: </Span> The amount of water held in the air. Humidity when too high

        <span class="Term" id="Wind">Wind: </Span> The natural movement of air. Wind has a cooling effect that is
        unique from that of temperatures. Wind cools the body by passsing through the clothes, and replacing the

        <span class="Term" id="Rain">Rain: </Span> When the day's forecast check passes both humidity and wind, it

        rain lasts for only one hour, but when conditions are right, multiple consecutive hours can have rain, when
        this occurs, the G.M. can use other attributes in the forcast to decide the strength of the storm as well as

        <span class="Term" id="Weapons">Weapons: </Span> A weapon is any item held with offensive intent. These items
        are used to amplify a character's offensive power, and focus them into stronger attacks.
        <br><br> Weapons come primarily in two forms;
        <br><b>Melee:</b> Swords, axes, spears, etc. that attack to a specic consistent range, and are powered by the

        <br><br><b>Ranged:</b> Bows, slings, firearms, etc. that have no hard limit to the distance at which they can
        land attacks, and are powered by mechanisms contained within the weapon.

        <br><br>All weapons concentrate a character's abilities through their "weapon stats". These include;
        <br>- Sharpness
        <br>- Range
        <br>- Balance

        <span class="Term" id="Attacks">Attacks: </Span> Offensive actions with the intent to cause harm to another
        entity.
        <br> When performing an attack, characters will need to perform two rolls, first <b>Target,</b> and then
        <b>To-Hit.</b> <br>
        <br>The Target roll <b>is not a check.</b> It simply determines what locations on the target are most
        available to be struck. In the case of mundane creatures, one dice is used to represent the limb while the
        other represents the spot on that limb. Which is which is up to the discretion of the directing player.
        Character's can use focus to target less armored, or more vulnerable spots on their opponent.
        <br><br> Then the acting character will perform their To-Hit roll. This roll determines <b>if</b> and <b>how
          hard</b> the character will land their attack.
        <br>This check is performed using a relavant offensive ability class or Dexterity with a penalty.
        <br><br>- If this check passes, the attack will land at the intended power.
        <br>- If the check passes with a pair, the damage dealt will be doubled.
        <br><br> If the check fails, melee weapons will deal half damage, while ranged weapons will miss to a degree
        equal to how badly the check failed.
        <br><br> If the check fails with a pair, melee weapons will miss entirely, and leave the acting character
        destabilized for the moment, while ranged attacks will miss severely, striking the worst available mark.

        <span class="Term" id="Grapple">Grappling: </Span> The act of one character physically restraining or
        wrestling another entity into submission.<br> When two entities enter a grapple they most both roll, the sum
        of both dice, their strength, and their weight, determines their <b>grapple advantage.</b>
        <br>This means <b>heavier, stronger</b> characters will be more difficult to win grapples against.
        <br><br>* Having certain ability classes can be used as an additional grapple advantage, but these advantages

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Power-Lvl">Attack Power: </Span> The intended force put into an attack. This value

        <br>Level 4: 3 recovery, increased damage.
        <br>Level 5: 4 recovery, double damage.
        <br><Br> Recovery moments are moments in a round when the acting character is commited to the attack, and
        <b>cannot perform any actions.</b> These are les severe on characters with high speed, as their actions take
        less time than those of slower characters.
        <br> The structure of an attack, where recovery & hit moments fall is decided by the directing player, but
        recovery moments <b>must</b> me adjacent to their hit moment.
        <br><br>
        <div class="Note">* Power Levels only apply to melee attacks. Ranged weapons all have their
          own damage modifiers.
          <br><br>Bows can be drawn to a power level equal to or below their draw weight.

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Hit-Moment">Hit Moments: </Span> The moment in a round when a melee attack lands. This
        moment must be surrounded by any necessary recovery moments. If the hit moments of two attacking characters
        overlap, the attacks will clash, with the stronger attack parrying the weaker one, destabilizing that attacker.
        relative to how much stronger the winning attack was.
        <br><br>* Certain techniques can be performed out of these clashes to avoid the risk of being parried.

        <br><br>* A character's resistance to being parried is determined by their Speed.

        <br><br>* Even when parried or destabilized, characters can escape treacherous situations using the free
        technique
        <b>scramble.</b>

        <div class="Note">* The hit moment of ranged attacks is determined by the distance to the
          target.

          every
          multiple of a weapon's flat effective range away the hit-moment will advance one moment later.
          <br><br> For example: If a bow's effective range is 10 spaces, and the target is 30 spaces away when the
          attack
          is fired. the hit moment is two moments later.

        it breaks. The amount of damage that is reduced by clothing & armor is a portion of it's DT. When recieving
        damage, if the damage dealt to a piece of armor is greater than it's DT, the armor is destroyed at that spot.
        It's
        DT will be subtracted from the damage value and, and the new damage value will be dealt to the layers beneath.
        <br><br>* only when armor is broken will it lend it's <b>full DT</b> to stopping the attack that broke it. This
        is
        an armor piece's desperate attempt to defend it's wearer, and the wearer's final warning before things get
        dangerous.
        <br> All items have a DT, because all things can be broken given enough force. DT is determined by the material

        <span class="Term" id="PD">Padding: </Span> The portion of an armor piece's DT that will <b>always reduce
          incoming
          damage.</b> This is determined by the amor's construction. A crude metal plate is difficult to break, but
        easily
        transmits force through it, while padded jackets are easy to pierce, but absorb force well.
        <Br> Due to this, proper armor should be layered, with padding protected under high a high DT outerlayer.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Deflection">Deflection: </Span>Certain types of armor encourage incoming attacks to
        deflect. Most often this is due to it's curved, or grooved shapes. An armor's deflection rating is added as
        penalties to the incoming attack's To-Hit roll. The attack will also gain an additional penlalty for every rank
        of
        sharpness the weapon has above 3.<br>
        Blunt weapons nullify deflection based on how far from 3 Sharpness they are. Meaning a weapon with sharpness 1
        can
        ignore two points of DT.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Balance">Balance: </Span> How a melee weapon holds it's weight. Specifically, "balance"
        refers to the amount of weight a weapon holds at it's base, while "Weight" in <b>this context</b> is the weight
        held at the end of it's effective range.
        <br>A higher "weight" means higher damage swinging attacks, as well as more penalties when trying to focus
        thrusting attacks.
        <br>Generally you want a swinging weapon with a high "weight", and thrusting weapons to have high balance.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Sharpness">Sharpness: </Span> The degree to which force will be focused & amplified.
        Sharpness comes in two forms, Edge and Point. Edge sharpness is used for swinging attacks, while point is used
        for
        thrusting attacks. The benefit of sharpness is amplified by a character's dexterity, having both high will
        result
        in incredibly damaging attacks. However high sharpness also increases the chance for deflection, as every point
        of
        sharpness above three adds a penalty to the To-Hit roll of attacks targeting armor with the Deflection property,
        while blunt weapons will nullify deflection by adding advantages relative to how low their sharpness is.
        <br>Sharpness is lowered when a weapon is chipped too many times, and raised when sharpened by an entity.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Chips">Chips: </Span> Whenever a weapon absorbs damage equal to half it's DT, it will
        recieve a chip. When the number of chips is equal to the weapon's Retention the weapon's sharpness is lowered.
        <br>The chips for edge and point sharpness are tracked seperately, thus it's possible to dull the edge of a
        sword,
        while it's point remains razor sharp.
        <br>Chips may be removed through regular maintenence of a weapon.
        <br><br>* Chips may also be added when a weapon is mistreated in someway.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Retention">Retention: </Span>The ability of a material to hold it's shape, and resist
        chipping. Retention determines the number of chips a weapon can recieve before it's relavant sharpness is
        dulled.
        Retention like DT is a property of the material the weapon is made of, and thus cannot be modified except
        through
        magic or mechanical reinforcement.

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Length">Length: </Span> The literal length of a weapon, it's maximum reach. Length is
        <b>always</b> the range used for thrusting attacks, unless modified by special techniques.
        <br> Length however, is seperate from effective range, and it's possible for an attack to deal reduced damage
        for
        landing at the end of it's length, <b>beyond it's effective range.</b>
        <br><br>* Certain weapons may use their length as the effective range for thrusting attacks, while the range
        value
        is used for swinging attacks.
        <br>

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Range">Range: </Span> A melee weapon's effective range determines whether or not it will
        deal it's full damage or not. attacks that land on targets too close, or too far will have their damage reduced
        relative to how far away from the "sweet spot" the target is when the attack lands. For this reason it may be
        preferable to rush in on opponent's equipped with long weapons in order to reduce the incoming damage as much as
        possible.
        <br><br>A Ranged Weapon doesn't have a "sweet spot" and will always deal it's intended damage to the target,
        unless deflected. All ranged weapons have ranges that determine the distance a target can be before incurring a
        target penalty. Ranged weapons can attack to any distance beyond their effective range, but will incur more
        penalties the further the target is.
        <br><Br>* The effective range of bot melee and ranged weapons can be modified by certain techniques.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Shape-Mod.">Shape Modifier: </Span> Certain weapons are designed to impart a mechanical
        advantage to swinging or thrusting attacks. These amplify the damage dealt my the relavant attack type.
        <br>Shape modifiers are based on the structure of a weapon, and cannot be modified without changing the weapon's
        shape through magic of mechanical means.

        <br>Combat lasts until the directing player requests it to end, however this means that other entites may turn
        in
        another ticket to gain a free first round to act. So exercise caution.
        <br>It's best to only end combat when one is sure all their enemies are dead, restrained, routed, or

        <br>When submitting a partial ticket, characters may submit actions only up to certain breakpoints denoted by
        the
        alternating colors of the actions on one's character's sheet.
        <br>This allows a directing player to see what happens in the set moments before commiting to the rest of their

        <span class="Term" id="Moments">Moments: </Span> Subdivisions of a round based on the acting character's speed.
        On any moment an action can be performed. When all tickets are submitted to the G.M., all roundes occur
        simultaneously. Attacks, and the consquences of actions can interrupt or cancel the actions of other characters,
        based on when they occur. For this reason, it's important to ensure one has the space and time necessary to
        perform their intended actions without being intterupted.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Actions">Actions: </Span> Any act performed is one action. For example;

        <br><br>The above process consists of six actions. Meaning it would take any un-altered human at least two
        rounds to use an item kept in such a back pack.
        <br> Actions also include movement, attacks, communication, and defense.
        <br>Without the use of special techniques, the only action that can be performed along with another is movement,

        <span class="Term" id="Quick-Access">Quick-Access: </Span> Certain articles that provide pockets grant the
        Quick-Access technique to characters attempting to retrieve contained items. In combat, this means that the

        <br>Such articles include utility belts, bandoliers, holsters, and scabbards.

        <br> Evasive movement has no effect on incoming damage, and evading characters can still be hit while evading.
        For this reason it's best to carefully choose the direction one evades carefully, as closing the distance on an
        enemy using a long weapon may be more advantageous than avoiding the hit all together.

        HP is determined for, mundane entities, entirely by size. HP determines how quickly entities succumb to wounds,
        and how quickly they bleed out.
        <br> Characters may lose HP due to illness, injuries, or satiety deprivation, but most often HP will be lost
        during combat through bleeding.
        <br>Hp is regained naturally at a rate of 1 HP per hour. This effect stops when <b>any form of satiety</b> is
        zero, and natural healing can be amplified through the use of spells and medicine.
        <br>When a character's HP reaches zero that character is considered down.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Bleeding">Bleeding: </Span> Blood loss can be caused in a variety of ways, and is the
        primary form of dealing damage to characters in combat.
        <br>There are two kinds of bleeds characters can sustain;
        <br><br><b>Lesser Bleeds:</b> Caused by bruising, or minor cuts. These are caused by any damage sustained by a
        character that does <b>not</b> pass that character's bleed threshold. The damage taken is placed in an empty
        bleed stack, and the character will take 1 damage at the start of every round, until they've taken the full
        damage value they sustained.
        <br>Character's may have five active lesser bleed stacks at a time. Meaning the max amount of damage a character
        can sustain from lesser bleeds is 5 hp per round, thus, a character with full bleed stacks may only remain
        active for a maximum of five rounds before they are downed.
        <br>Lesser bleeds are a slow killer, once damage starts piling on a character it's only a matter of time before
        they can no longer continue fighting.
        <br>Once combat is over, bleed stacks are totalled, halved, and that value is then subtracted from the
        character's HP. If the character's HP is reduced to zero, they are rendered unconcious, a state identical to
        sleep.
        <br><b>Lesser bleeds END when a character is downed. bleed stacks CAN NOT passively consume DP.</b>
        <br><br><b>Greater Bleeds:</b>When a character sustains significant damage, such that the value dealt surpasses
        their bleed threshold. A Greater Bleed is caused. The greater bleed will last one round for every ten points of
        damage above the bleed threshold the character sustained, with a minimum of one round.
        <br>During every round of the greater bleed, the affected character will lose 10 HP at a rate equal to 2HP every
        speed 5 moment. This will be tracked by the G.M., and progresses as the affected character submits their
        tickets.
        <BR> Greater bleeds can only be stopped by characters a relavant ability. once staunched, either through medical
        intervention, or naturally, fatal bleeds will become a <b>permanant</b> lesser bleed stack.
        <br>If a character goes down, with an <B>active greater bleed</b> that greater bleed will deplete the
        character's DP by 1 every round, for as many rounds as is left in the greater bleed.
        <br><br>* When a character's HP reaches 0, they can perform a stamina check to force themselves concious. If
        this is successful, HP remains zero, they may continue to act, but the check must be repeated every round with
        an additional penalty, and <b>any hit</b> will knock them straight into unconciousness, with no chance to
        resist.
        <br><br>* Bleed threshold is determined by a character's constitution.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Injuries">Injuries: </Span> When a character sustains damage that exceeds their EDT, they
        must roll an endurance check that will determine if they are injured. If the check fails with a pair, the
        character's limb will be crippled, doubling both the negative effects, and recovery time of the injury.
        <br>Injured limbs will grant penalties to any check that requires their use as well as the debuffs listed on the
        Armor Grids.
        While crippled limbs <b>cannot</b> be used until they heal, and once their recovery time is past, they become
        injured for the same time they were crippled.
        <br><br>* Crippled and injured limbs, have a chance to impart negative quirks on characters.

        character.
        <br> Damage is past through the grids from right to left, meaning the armor displayed furthest right will be the
        first to break when attacked.
        <br>A proper armor setup should have high DT articles covering high PD articles beneath. This way the character

        <br>In practice it's better to think of these spaces as cubes. Humans areconsidered to be two spaces tall. This
        is the amount of space that's comfortable to occupy. passing through tighter spaces will depend on a character's

        move cardinally, and four actions to pass diagonally through these spaces.
        <br>Additionally, destabilizing effects when on rough terrain are worsened, either increasing the number of
        moments, a character is off balance, or knocking them prone.
        <br>When a character has moved consecutively through as many rough terrain spaces as they have ranks in stamina,
        they will lose one skill card. If they have no skill cards left, they will roll an endurance check to sustain a
        minor injury.
        <br><br>Outside of combat, the same rules still apply, but character's can move more slowly, reducing their risk

        <br>Dashing characters must still count half steps when passing diagonally through spaces.
        <br><br>* Because dashing only ends when the acting character's consecutive movement is broken, this means that
        if a character has access to a technique that allows actions to be taken during a dash, other techniques such as
        <i>Fletch,</i> evasive movements, or <i>Harvest Flurry</i> can be taken without breaking the dash, thus doubling

        every space laterally they move, one space of height is lost. characters move through the air 2 spaces per
        moment, and are considered destabilized while off the ground. Jumping characters will be destabilized as well
        the moment after they land.
        <br><br>* Jumping during a dash will double the lateral distance a character can cover during their jump without
        increasing the loss to vertical height.
        <br><br>* Character's can use evasive movement to exit their landing destabilization.
        <br><br>* If a character is struck, or acted upon in the air, a speed check must be performed when landing to

        <span class="Term" id="Inventory">Inventory: </Span> The stock of items kept on a character. Character's
        Inventory are represented by the pockets of their current Tack. A character's inventory is limited to what they
        can hold in both arms, what fits in their pockets, and what they can have equipped.
        <br> When the content's of a character's inventory exceeds their carry weight, the character's weight will
        increase relative to how overweight their inventory is. Encumbered characters will have their athleticism
        reduced by one.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Pockets">Pockets: </Span> Any bag, pouch, or holster currently in a character's Tack will
        add itself to the character's inventory. All pockets have a weight limit determined by the quality of their
        construction, and the sturdiness of the material they're made from. Pockets also contain slots that may house
        items who's size does not exceed the number of slots present in the pocket.

        large items.
        <br>Size zero items take up only as much space as their name, and thus can be abreviated to save space. However,
        if a directing player can ever not remember what an item is, that item is considered lost, and may turn up again
        in the world, or be found by other characters.

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Tack">Tack: </Span> All eqquiped items, including jewlery, clothes, armor, and weapons.
        Tacked items do not add to a character's weight limit, and most tacked items will contribute to a character's
        resistances.
        <br>Weapons must be tacked before they can be used, and characters cannot have more weapons tacked than they can
        hold in both hands. Unless those weapons have scabbards, sheaths, or holsters, at which point, they no longer
        require the use of a character's arms to be readied.

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Resistances">Resistances: </Span> A character's abiility to endure the elements. Most
        commonly this refers to a character's Insulation, Absorbance, Conductivity, and Brilliance. Which are determined
        by the articles one wears.
        <br><b>Insulation:</b> A character's resistance to changes in temperature, and how well their tacked articles
        contain heat.
        <br>Insulation also determines how much heat is needed to ignite a material, and set it on fire. As well as how
        quickly that fire will spread.
        <br>
        <br><b>Absorbance:</b> A character's resistance to being saturated by liquids, and thus inhereiting their
        special effects. Absorbance also determines how long an article will take to dry when it's saturated (6-Abs
        hours).
        <br>
        <br><b>Conductivity:</b> A character's resistance to electric currents. Electricity will always target the
        object or entity within it's range with the <b>highest</b> conductivity.
        <br>
        <br><b>Brilliance:</b> How striking a character is to the senses. This affects how a character is percieved
        socially, as well as how easy or difficult they are to target with magic.
        <br><br>* When saturated with dirt, a character's brilliance becomes zero, regardless of what they're wearing.
        <br>


        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Articles">Articles: </Span>Anything that is "worn" by a character, including jewelery,
        clothes, shoes, and armor. All articles contribute to a character's resistances, but not necesarily to their

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Storage">Storage: </Span> When character's set down or discard items from their inventory
        that they may want to reaquire later, they may place them in one of the three storage sections on their sheets.
        These sections function identically to the character's inventory, and serve only to help track what items were
        left where. They can also be named by the directing players to better help track where these items are located.
        <br><br>* Certain techniques such as maintaining a <i>Summoner's Vault</i> require the use of a storage section
        to represent the vault's contents. Other permanent uses for storage sections include wagons, and pack animals.

        pressurized systems. The mundane world is one of science, and engineering. Mundane objects and entities have no

        <span class="Term" id="Ethereality">Ethereality: </Span> To be entirely foreign in nature to the natural world.
        Ethereality is the realm of the fluid & abstract. It is a world where force of thought reign over physical

        <span class="Term" id="Magic">Magic: </Span>The ability of a mundane entity to use the dominion of ethereal
        entites over the natural elements, to bend the natural laws in their favor.
        <Br>All magic is some form of communication between ethereal and mundane entities to affect the natural state of
        things.
        <br><br>More practically speaking, all magic must be cast through an entity of the opposing nature. Which is to
        say; All magic is the commanding of ethereal entities to exercise their influence over the natural elements.
        <br> This means that for a spell to be cast, a character <b>must</b> have some sort of connection to the
        unnatural, <b>as well as</b> an ability to communicate their intention (Spell ).
        <br>Spells exist in-game as Insight Techniques.
        <div class="note">* <i>With certain exceptions.</i></div>
        <br> These techniques when used function similiarly to attacks, in that they require two rolls.
        <br>The <b>Connection</b> roll, which functions similiarly to an attack's <b>target</b> roll, and the
        <b>Cast</b> check, which functions similiarly to an attack's <b>To-Hit</b> roll.
        <br><Br> <b>Connection:</b> To target an entity or object with magic, a character must be able to focus on them
        either by physically touching it, visually seeing it, or mentally imagining it. These methods all take the form
        of different rolls with the exception of physical touch. Making physical contact with the intended target has no
        chance of failure.
        <br>When connection visually, characters must pass a perception check. While connecting mentally, they must pass
        an intelligence check.
        <br>Connection checks are all subject to the usual penalties one might encounter. Failing this check will risk
        the spell targeting something unintended. perception based connection checks function identically when missing
        to ranged weapon misses, while intelligence based connection checks risk targeting items of similiar
        description.
        <br>For example a failed intelligence connection check meant to target a blonde enemy, might strike a different
        blonde character in the vicinity.
        <br><br>Creating connections is easier on targets with high brilliance, and lower on targets with low
        brilliance. For this reason dressing plainly is advantageous when facing magic users.
        <br><br>* Characters can make as many connections of one type as they have ranks in the relavant trait, however
        every current connection is added as a penalty to additional connection rolls.
        <br><br>* Spells must assert how many connections they can accept in their definition.
        <br><Br> <b>Casting:</b> A spell's "To-Hit" roll, this determines <b>if</b> your spell goes off, as well as
        <b>how effective</b> it is.
        <bR>All Casting rolls are ability checks, with the relavant ability in question being <b>any understanding of an
          ethereal entity.</b>
        <br><br>Failing a cast check means the entity will not fully understand your intent, this could lead to a
        variety of different failures dependant on the spell you're using. Failing with a pair risks angering the
        entreated entity, adding penalties to future casting attempts, while passing with a pair may amplify the effects
        of the spell, or potentially provide other benefits based on context or the entity.
        <br><br>* Not all entites have influence over all elements, and thus some entities will be able to offer more
        powerful results in certain dominions than others.

        <span class="Term" id="Elements">Elements: </Span> The natural elements are what create the mundane world, the
        manipulation of these forces are refered to based on their methods; They can be exploited through mechanical
        principles through science and engineering, or manipulated through cooperation with the ethereal through magic.
        <br>All elements define existence itself, and no one is superior to another. They are equivalent peers extant in
        harmony with one another.
        <br>The natural Elements are listed below;
        <br><br><b>Permeability:</b> How readily one accepts another. The strength of boundaries between substances.
        Without permeability all the world would collapse into a great dissolution, much like the natural state of
        ethereality. Permeability is expressed in the very existence of distinction, individuality exists because one
        insists upon itself.
        <br>A more digestible example is a material's resistance to absorbance. Articles weak to absorbance readily
        accept the properties of fluids poured onto them, some even become permanantly stained, never to return to how
        they once were. A change due only to contact with another substance.
        <br>Another example would be a character's constitution, their resistance to the alterative effects of medicine
        & toxins.
        <br><Br>* DT & PD are also attributes within the dominion of permeability, as they determine how a material
        reacts and accepts <i>forces.</i>
        <br><br><b>Heat:</b> The existence of motion in stillness. Heat the opposite of heat is not cold, but heat's
        absence, as the opposite of motion is stillness.
        <br>An obvious experession of this element is in the day's temperature, and the ability of insulated clothing to
        resist it's change.
        <br>Though, a more accurate representation would be satiety, as mundane creatures must consume fuel, which is
        then burned internally to generate their movements, this energy is expended more quickly through actions
        requiring the use of cards.
        <br><Br>* Fire is <b>not</b> withint he dominion of heat, as it is a reaction <b>to</b> heat. While heat cannot
        inherently create fire, i
        <br><br><b>Electricity:</B> The innate power extant in nature, that flows like a river through all things. from
        the explosive bolts of lighting in dark storms, to the invisible hand that repels magnets. Electricity seeks
        dispersion, it exists as a field that grows relative to the strength of the charge. when this field contacts a
        material without, the charge dumps itself along the <b>least resistant</b> path to dispell itself back among the
        world.
        <br> This sudden, and at times violent, transfer of energy can, at times create intense heat as well as
        repulsive or attractive forces.
        <br> The opposite of electricity is an ethereal phenomenon known as masaic charges. this ethereal force behaves
        identical to electricity but only bears it's effect in the ethereal world.
        <br><br>* Masiac charges are the most common way for mundane entities to engage in the ethereal in combat.
        <br><br><b>Time:</b> The continuous passage from one state to the next. Time is what allows the world to
        progress. Without the passage of time life would have no meaning.
        <br>Time is most plainly seen in the passing of hours, and their decaying effect on satiety & experience. Time
        is what allows the world to live.
        <BR>The opposite of time is <i>anti-time</i> Pockets of time that exist in tandem, simultaneously with natural
        time.
        <br><br><b>Space:</b> The dimensions of height, width, and depth. The element that allows the existence of
        distance.
        <br>Space is most obviously expressed in the existence of spaces on combat fields, or the measure of one's
        height & movement speed.
        <br>The opposite of space is <i>anti-space.</i> Pockets of unnatural space that exist in tandem with natural
        spaces.
        <br><br><b>Force:</b> The physical pressure created in the collision of matter. Kinetic forces are most easily
        observed in the existence of damage, which is simply the mechanical generation of force, amplified through
        sharpness and shape modifiers.
        <br>However the most accurate expression of elemental force is gravity, the attraction of objects to their
        greaters.
        <br>For this reason, the natural state of elemental force is attractive, it's opposite are repellant forces.
        <br><br><b>Substance:</b> Mass, and the material properties. Substance defines what a thing <b>is,</b> and how
        it reacts to it's peers & pressures.
        <br><br>* When creating substance from absence ethereal entities may produce one of two substances,
        <i>Incense</i> or <i>Miasma</i>. Though these substances are the inverse of eachother most entities will have
        access only to one or the other.
        <br><br><b>Information:</b> Sense within noise, intelligibility, meaning. All patterns are the dominion of
        intelligence.
        <br>Elemental information is expressed through words, through sights, through experiences. It is self evident.

        character's that know them into more complex, and specialized <b>compound spells.</b> Compound spells are the
        most common, and useful spells a character can know.
        <br>Spells are all considered insights.
        <br>
        <div class="Note">* Unless learned through certain mutations.
        </div><br><br>All basic spells have a cost of 1 • their potency. Characters may cast spells at potencies equal
        to or less than their wisdom, while ethereal entities may only perform spells at potencies that are equal to or
        less than their dominion over the relevant element.
        <br><br>Thus, when casting spells, the power of the spell is limited first by the acting character's wisdom, and
        then by the relavent entity's dominion.
        <br><br>Among the basic spells, there exist two kinds; Levidromic spells, who's functions invert when cast
        backwards, and palindromic spells, which have the same function regardless of how they're cast.
        <br>Levidromic spells are learned in only one direction at a time. Inverted spells must be learned seperately.
        <br><br>Listed here are all basic spells;


        <div class="Note">
          <br><br><b>~Levidromic~</b>
          <b>Generate:</b> Create from nothing an amount determined by potency of an element at the point of connection.
          <br>When cast in reverse, Generate becomes Remove, and instead destroys an element.
          <br><br>* The spell Remove(Heat) is how one would "generate cold"


          <br><br><b>Seek:</b> Detect a specific attribute or element.
          <bR>When cast in reverse, Seek becomes Avoid, and can be used to direct a spell away from it's target.
          <br><br>* This avoidance behavior can be used to have a spell autonomously avoid detection, or detterents.


          <br><br><b>Trigger:</b> When used in a compound spel this spell will only proceed to the following effects
          <b>if</b> it detects it's targeted attribute or element. Useful for enchantments or traps.
          <br>When cast in reverse it activates when it detects the <b>absense</b> of it's target. Be careful as this
          could mean the trigger goes off imediately upon casting, if it were cast into an enviornment where it's target
          doesn't exist.
          <br><br>* Trigger can be used with Seek, and will go off as soon as Seek finds it's target.
          <br>Potency detects the sensitivity of the trigger, with 1 requiring a great change to activate, and 5
          activatinge at the faintest hint.
          <br><br>* The Define spell can be used to further specify what exactly sets off this spell.

          <br><br><b>Correlate:</b> tie two connected attributes together, mirroring effects from one to the other. when
          cast in reverse, the relationship becomes inverted, thus when one value raises, the other lowers.
          <br>Potency has no effectm on this spell.

          <br><br><b>Amplify:</b>Raise a connected value. When cast in reverse, amplify becomes dampen, and values can
          be lowered.
          <Br>Potency determines how great the change is to the target.
          <br><br>* Amplify can be used on the potencies of other spells, allowing mundane castors to conjure
          frightingly powerful effects. (Up to the limit of their entity's dominion.)

          <br><br><b>Designate:</b> Specify a connected object, designate a region on the surface of the connection, or
          a three-dimensional field around the point of connection for following effects to take place within.
          <br>The potency of this spell determines the maximum number of connected objects to designate, or the size of
          the area to act upon.
          <br>when cast in reverse, Designate becomes Exclude, and instead defines connected objects and areas to
          <b>not</b> affect with the following spells.
          <br><Br>* In the event that this spell is used for an area effect by excluding the area the effect
          <b>doesn't</b> happen in, the distance of the effect will be determined by the relavant entity's dominion.
          <br><br>* Designate can be used with Seek and Connect to define a search area around the initial point of
          connection. The connect spell could then be used to autonomously find new targets to act on with following
          spells.

          <br><br><b>Breach:</b> Open a tear in the curtain that seperates the mundane from the ethereal.
          <br>The potency of this spell determines the size of the breach.
          <br>When cast in reverse, this spell will instead close tears to the otherside.
          <br><br>* Because inverted spells are learned seperately, one must be very careful with this spell, so as not
          to open breaches they cannot close. Afterall, there's no telling what may come through something like that...


          <br><br><b>Remember:</b> Identify the current state of the connected object.
          <br> Potency determines the accuracy of the memory.
          <br>When cast in reverse, this spell instead clears remembered states. In this case, Potency will determine
          how much of the memory to clear.
          <br>This spell does nothing on it's own, and must be paired with Recall or other spells to get some kind of
          effect.


          <br><br><b>Recall:</b> Return to a remembered state. This spell has no function if not fed a state through
          either Remember or generated information.
          <br>Potency determines how accurate to the memory the recalled state is.
          <br>When cast in reverse, Recall becomes Resist, and remembered states are instead resisted.


          <br><br><b>Seal:</b>Create a magical lock, binding ethereal entities to objects.
          <br>Potency determines the strength of the lock, and how difficult it is for the entity to escape it.
          <br>When cast in reverse Seal becomes Release, and instead breaks already placed locks. In this case, potency
          <b>must</b> be <b>exactly equal</b> to the potency of the lock. The use of improper release spells could be
          rather... Explosive in nature.


          <br><br><b>Define:</b>Specify shape, form, or color. Define allows spells to be specific in their function. It
          turns shapeless repellant forces into targeted, aimable, attacks.
          <br>Define is the <b>most important spell</b> for the creation of compound spells.
          <br>Potency determines the specificity of the definition.
          <br>When cast in reverse Define becomes Obscure, and destroys the target organized structures, reducing them
          to noise.


          <br><br><b>Set:</b>A terminal spell used to place enchantments and curses. Set spells no longer affect the
          caster's cards, even when the set spell includes Sustains.
          Potency determines how resilient the enchantment is to being desecrated.
          <br><br>* This spell can be learned through the Enchanter class.


          <br><br><b>~Palindromic~</b>
          <br><br><b>Connect:</b> Create new connections. While this spell does nothing on it's own, it can be combined
          with Designate and Seek to create powerful wide reaching, or multi-target spells.
          <br>Potency has no effect on this spell.


          <br><br><b>Sustain:</b> Continue and hold all affected spell effects. Without sustain, all spells occur and
          dissipate immediatly.
          <br>Potency determines the number of spells that can be sustained.
          <br><br>* Sustain is <b>neccesary</b> for buff and debuff spells to hold their effect.
          <br><br>* While Sustained spells remain active until the castor chooses to release them. Until that point the
          cards consumed by Sustained Spells <b>cannot</b> be refunded using satiety.


          <br><br><b>Transmute:</b>Alter individual properties of a material, such as it's DT, PD, or special effects.
          <br>Transmutation can change special effects, but cannot add or remove them except on rare occasions.
          <bR><br>* Transmute, by default, can only alter one propertie at a time.


          <br><br><b>Repeat:</b> Repeat the effects of the targeted spells.
          <br>Potency determines how many spells may be attached.

        <br>
        <span class="Term" id="Potency">Potency: </Span> The power of cast spells, potency has a variety of effects on
        the different base spells.
        <br>The most simple way to imagine the effect of potency is through the basic spell <i>Generate(Force).</i>
        <br>Potency 1: A light wafting.
        <br>Potency 2: A refreshing breeze.
        <br>Potency 3: A chilling gust of air.
        <br>Potency 4: A destabilizing gust of air.
        <br>Potency 5: A violent blast.
        <br><br>Potency is the first limiting factor when it comes to casting powerful spells, as a character can only
        cast spells up to a potency of their wisdom rank.
