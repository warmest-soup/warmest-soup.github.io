  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">Somewhere in the vast and wild reaches of the Delrossian
    Frontier. A lonely beast, or perhaps a man, stalks the trees. A stray dog fills a glass with sheep's tears. Inhuman
    voices, flash, and fire, burn the trees.<br>An <span class="ItalicRendererV2-container">Ivory Serpent</span>
    continues to fill the land with it's venom...<br>...And Silent girl hustles about the shops and vendors at market, in search of curios and commodities.
  </div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">Llaide arrives with Sylvia trailing shortly behind her at
    the bustling market. The day is nearing noon and the weather is fair. From beneath her hood she see all types of
    people gathered at this bastion of civilization, all colors and creeds of consumers browse, and a variety of beasts
    tow stock and travel carriages.</div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">Parfii is silent today, perhaps not yet entirely awake, and
    with Sylvia yet to catch up to her, it serms she have some time to think. What will she look at first? What
    Wonderous snacks might be on sale? And how long will Sylvia let her stay out?</div>
  <br><span class="GradientText-container GuildedText-container GuildedText-container-type-heading4 GuildedText-container-ellipsify GuildedText-container-shadow TeamWidgetProfileDetails-name" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); text-decoration-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span class="GradientText-wrapper"><span class="GradientText-layer GradientText-base">MangoSoysu<span class="GradientText-layer GradientText-overlay" style="color: rgb(255, 224, 138);">MangoSoysu</span></span></span></span>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">Llaide excitedly walks through the stalls, a little hop to
    jer steps, as Sylvia trails behind her in a less excited manner. </div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">Sylvia diligently keeps track of the time, making sure they
    won't be out longer than 5 hours as per the family's orders. Follow the routine; walk around the stalls, grab some
    lunch, head to the shop of interest for the day and go home. </div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">Llaide gently taps at parfii, telepathically communicating
    with him to rouse him awake. 'Parfii, is there anything you'd like to look for today?' </div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">She would usually look at gems and jewelry as Parfii was
    quite fond of such purchase, but maybe something different was in order. Maybe a pretty sword for her elder
    brothers? She didnt quite understand why they walked around with such dull looking scabbards and why the swords they
    used were undecorated. They gave her such a pretty dagger, it's only right that her brothers' own equipment were
    pretty too.</div>
  <br><span class="GradientText-container GuildedText-container GuildedText-container-type-heading4 GuildedText-container-ellipsify GuildedText-container-shadow TeamWidgetProfileDetails-name" style="color: rgb(92, 184, 255); text-decoration-color: rgb(92, 184, 255);"><span class="GradientText-wrapper"><span class="GradientText-layer GradientText-base">Warmest-Soup<span class="GradientText-layer GradientText-overlay" style="color: rgb(255, 194, 194);">Warmest-Soup</span></span></span></span>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">In response to Llaide's gentle tapping, the trinket coiled
    around her neck begins to vibrate, and emanate a soothing warmth as Parfii wakes, "oh? Is it that time already?
    Well... Maybe some they have some new jewels in? Something big and shiny shiny!" He giggles to himself as the
    thoughts wake him, "ooh! Or how about we find a ritzy tailor with some nice fabrics I could roll around in?" Parfiis
    excited ramblings become a comforting background noise as Llaide notices a new vendor setting up shop, by the looks
    of it a weapon smith. And from what she can tell one of high quality. "Oh! And snacks! Llaide! Snacks please!
    Something big! I'm soooo hungry" he whines dramatically.</div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">(Perception Crit Success)</div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-none">Llaide can't help but also notice a pair of men in the
    crowd behaving oddly, one on both sides of the street, but they don't appear to be dressed at all alike. One has the
    look of a ruffian, shirtless, with pierced ears, from which thin gold hoops hang, and the other is dressed
    professionally, bright and pastel shades of fusia and green, with a turban around his head, this one bares the look
    of some foreign envoy, or dignitary. <br>Perhaps she is just being paranoid?</div>
  <br><span class="GradientText-container GuildedText-container GuildedText-container-type-heading4 GuildedText-container-ellipsify GuildedText-container-shadow TeamWidgetProfileDetails-name" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); text-decoration-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span class="GradientText-wrapper"><span class="GradientText-layer GradientText-base">MangoSoysu<span class="GradientText-layer GradientText-overlay" style="color: rgb(255, 224, 138);">MangoSoysu</span></span></span></span>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">Although her book to avoid kidnapping for dummies did say
    to heed your worries always when it comes to your safety. A kidnappee once is at risk for being a kidnappee once
    more. Llaide internally nods as she remembers the wise teachings of the safety book that her self defense teacher
    gave her.</div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">It's not that she was a bad student or she was stupid, the
    book was just for reminding herself. Doesn't hurt to check. (perception check)</div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">The book also said to tell a trusted adult. </div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">Llaide looks at Sylvia for a second. Sylvia is only a few
    years older the her but I guess she counts. Oh, gotta tell Parfii too of course. 'I think those 2 people might be
    trouble. Could u keep an eye on them in case I'm right?'</div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">At the same time, Llaide rustles through her satchel for
    her notebook where she started righting to give Sylvia a heads up. "I'm thinking of going to the weapon's smith, I
    want to buy pretty swords for my elder brothers." Going back to writing in the notebook, she then flipped to the
    next page.</div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">"Also, we might be being watched."</div>

  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">"What!? Who!? Where!? Oh you leave 'em to me! I'll
    annihilate 'em! Nobody messes with my friend and gets away with it!" Parfii's furious rantings carry on in the back
    of Llaide's head as Sylvia catches up to her, "Lady! Where to first?" She smiles, placing her arm on Llaide's
    shoulder as she reads the first note. "Ah! How lovely! What a wonderful sister you are!" Sylvia squeezes her as her
    smile grows, "I wonder what sort they'd like?" She wonders aloud, but her face loses all optimism at the sight of
    the second note. <br>Sylvia clings to Llaide, holding her closer, while she looks out at the crowds, "I see them..." She growls softly. "Let's make our business here quick..."
  </div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">(Perception check success) </div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-none">While Sylvia was reading the notes, Llaide noticed the
    man in the turban staring directly at her. Their eyes meet. He waves and nods his head, and continues to stand at
    the corner. But when Llaide went to look back at the shirtless one, he was no longer there.</div>
  <br><span class="GradientText-container GuildedText-container GuildedText-container-type-heading4 GuildedText-container-ellipsify GuildedText-container-shadow TeamWidgetProfileDetails-name" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); text-decoration-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"><span class="GradientText-wrapper"><span class="GradientText-layer GradientText-base">MangoSoysu<span class="GradientText-layer GradientText-overlay" style="color: rgb(255, 224, 138);">MangoSoysu</span></span></span></span>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">'Just keep an eye on them for me' she giggles a little with
    how energetic Parfii was. 'We don't know for sure if the mean well or not. Noticing the shirtless man disappear, she
    asked Parfii 'Where did he go?' it should be wise for them to quickly buy the swords and have lunch in order to cut
    their trip short. Sadly she can't roam around more afterwards. </div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">Llaide looked at Sylvia and nodded in agreement as she
    locked arms with her dear friend. She pulls her along to the sword smith and looked at all their wares. Llaide found
    a pair of swords that were quite decorated, and she wanted to hold one to see how heavy they were. She pointed at
    one of the swords and looked at the shopkeeper and Sylvia, hoping they'd understand so she wouldn't have to write
    again.</div>
  <br><span class="GradientText-container GuildedText-container GuildedText-container-type-heading4 GuildedText-container-ellipsify GuildedText-container-shadow TeamWidgetProfileDetails-name" style="color: rgb(92, 184, 255); text-decoration-color: rgb(92, 184, 255);"><span class="GradientText-wrapper"><span class="GradientText-layer GradientText-base">Warmest-Soup<span class="GradientText-layer GradientText-overlay" style="color: rgb(255, 194, 194);">Warmest-Soup</span></span></span></span>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">Parfii responds, "He went behind the building, behind the
    smith... He's still there." Llaide can tell how hard Parfii us concentrating on the matter. </div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">"Excuse me, sir, could we take a look at those swords?"
    Sylvia and the weapon smith. <br>"Sorry, I'm not taking orders just yet." The tall, and grizzled Smith approaches. He easily towers over both you and Sylvia, and wears rugged dark clothes, the left half of his face sags, perhaps from some kind of injury, or condition, and his hairline is parted up the side by a large scar.
    <br>"We're still getting setup, won't be taking orders 'till next week, most like." He continues.
    <br>"Is that so? Could we still take a look at the weapons perhaps? To examine the quality? Perhaps get a pricing?"<br>The Smith sighs, and lumbers over to retrieve the sword, and places them on the counter.<br>"This piece was made by me, Warnel steal. The style is unorthodox, I learned it from an Eastern Smith. I find it quiet... Fascinating."
  </div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">The sword is long, single edged, and has a gentle curve to
    the narrow blade, so finely polished that it could almost serve as a mirror. Unlike most swords Llaide has seen the
    crossgaurd is an intricately decorated gold circle, from which a number of beaded strings hang down, connecting with
    the pommel to form a sort of decorative knuckle bow. The handle is wrapped In a brilliant red fabric, and a tri
    colour tassel serves as a final accent at the pommel.</div>

  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">(Perception check to track both men) 'Am I being too
    paranoid?' Llaide asks Parfii, feeling weird about how tense she is despite nothing happening so far. </div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">"Can we pre order or reserve these?" Llaide writes down her
    notebook and shows Sylvia. She liked the style very much and thought it to be very pretty. She was hoping that they
    would accept a reservation or a pre order and maybe they could have the beaded strings colors changed so the 2
    swords would be slightly different. She'd have to wait for confirmation first though before she makes that request.
  </div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">Llaide looks at Sylvia, signaling her to ready some money
    just in case the smith says yes.</div>
  <br><span class="GradientText-container GuildedText-container GuildedText-container-type-heading4 GuildedText-container-ellipsify GuildedText-container-shadow TeamWidgetProfileDetails-name" style="color: rgb(92, 184, 255); text-decoration-color: rgb(92, 184, 255);"><span class="GradientText-wrapper"><span class="GradientText-layer GradientText-base">Warmest-Soup<span class="GradientText-layer GradientText-overlay" style="color: rgb(255, 194, 194);">Warmest-Soup</span></span></span></span>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">(Perception Failure) </div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-none">Llaide peers behind the smith trying to look through the
    connected stands and crowd for the shirtless man, but can't spot him through the obstructions. The well dressed man,
    remains at his position, he's not making any effort to be hidden.</div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">Sylvia relays Llaide's question to the Smith, who responds
    with a deep sigh. He strokes his dense beard with a tough and gnarled hand as he considers the request. </div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">'you're not being paranoid, you're being careful! Don't
    worry, I'm watchin' 'em...' Parfii assures her in his most serious tone, although it's not enough to counteract his
    usual shrimpy nature. </div>
  <div class="BlockTextRendererV2-container slate-margin-sm">"I can't sell ya' this one. It's a special order. Only if
    it's kind, and i ain't taking custom orders 'til I'm settled in.... <br>But... <br>I suppose if you're willing to pay, i got some stock somewhere i could show ya'. Maybe come by in an hour or so, I'll have 'em unpacked."
